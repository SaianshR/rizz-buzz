0,"When someone really likes you, it’s effortless.","Just keep this in mind. They text you right away or soon after, they will be excited to make plans to meet you, they’ll flirt and ask you questions, they’ll seem interested in your life.

What they won’t do is be unsure whether they’re free, leave you on read or wait hours to reply, not ask questions and  give you short replies.

Dating should be fun, and with the right person it is. If you find it hard work talking to them and they’re always busy, move on you deserve better",sgcach,11302,508,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sgcach/when_someone_really_likes_you_its_effortless/
1,My father told me this," 

My  father told me this when he walked up on me hiding behind his house  while I was bawling over my fiancée, who I just found out was cheating  on me.

“I  know right now you’re feeling desperate, angry, hurt and alone. And the  first thing you want to do is get revenge, sleep with other people and  hurt someone too. That’s normal. But you shouldn’t do that. Don’t be  like her. Don’t go down that path. You should always fall back on your  best character. Be the bigger person now, and you’ve already won. Feel  the pain for now. In a month you’ll see what I mean. And so will she. So  take your time. Be a good man. You’ll find someone who actually cares  about you. Maybe you’ll be alone, and that’s okay too. But you still  have your life and your character and you can’t throw that away because  of someone else who doesn’t have any.”

I’ve  thought about that every single day for a year now, and it has  propelled me to such strength, confidence, love and happiness.",sseson,8905,256,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sseson/my_father_told_me_this/
2,He said yes! I'm finally got the first date of my life,"UPDATE: Oh my god, I can't believe how many comments and upvotes I got on this silly little post, **THANKS!!!!!!** You guys wanted an update and I actually wanted to share with you what happened last night too. It was SO CRAZY,  I had to take melatonin to fall asleep. This update is long and stupid, but I hope you guys are happy with it.

After I posted this, I made a video call to my mom. I told her I finally had a date and she thought I was lying to her, then she got super excited and called my dad over and my dad was super happy too.

I was so excited after the phone call, and then I realized I didn't have anything to wear on the date, so I drove out and bought a dress. After that I texted him asking when I was going to pick him up and he texted back saying 4pm. I went home and got dressed and drove around because I didn't really want to stay at home, but I really wanted to see him so badly that I parked in front of the bookstore early and waited for him to come out. I think my heart was beating so fast that it was about to explode when I saw him walk out and he was super cute, super cute, super cute!!!!!! I need to stress a million times that **He! Super! Classy! Adorable! Lovely!** Now that I think about it I think my face was probably redder than the Chinese flag at the time lol.

He shook my hand, told me his name, he was very happy to meet me, I think I must have had some problem at that time, because I told him my name again, he laughed and said he already knew. I was so nervous in the car that I didn't talk to him at all, and he was quiet, then he asked me where we were going now, and I said to a restaurant, and he said it was too early, right? I said yes, and then there was another awkward silence. After that I parked in a parking lot and he asked me if I wanted to walk around a bit, I said let's walk around then, and then we walked around that restaurant several times. The whole time I was acting like a dorky goose, which was super weird, and although my brain kept telling me to just calm down and be cool and casual, I didn't think I could do it at all.

After we went into the restaurant, I asked him if he had ever eaten Japanese food before and he said he had. I thought he must have thought I was a weirdo because I asked him out and didn't talk, so he started asking me questions like what have I been doing lately and have I seen the new Matrix movie? I told him I had seen it and it was a horrible movie, even Keanu Reeves couldn't save it, and he instantly got excited and told me what he thought of the Matrix series, and then he asked if I would choose the red pill or the blue pill. Then I told him a bunch of reasons about why I would choose the red pill, and then he touched my hand!!!!!!! He told me he would have chosen the red pill too, told me that choosing the red pill was a philosophical question about existence and consciousness and that he was glad I would choose the red pill. He started talking about the connection between the blue pill and TikTok, and whether antiwork was due to self-awakening or just another cynic's orgy. He moved his chair over to sit next to me and poured me some tea. I asked him if his major was philosophy, and he said he was working on his PhD in philosophy, and that the bookstore was just a part-time job. He started asking me what I thought about feminism and the crisis of masculinity, and I told him that the development of feminism did not mean that male subjectivity was in danger, but that the crisis of masculinity was caused by the double emasculation of men by the patriarchal and class systems. I didn't know what shit I was talking about, but he accepted it, and he went on to talk about so much more stuff that I could understand well or not. He kept talking and I got a little tired of listening but he just couldn't stop finally I reminded him that we had been sitting here for 3 hours.

After we walked out, he told me he didn't really want to go home right now and wanted to walk around. He asked me if I wanted to join him, and of course I couldn't possibly say no! Then we walked around this restaurant several more times. He was quiet and I was quiet, and finally he gave me a long hug as I drove him home.

When I got home, he called me and said he was sorry he had been talking about him the whole evening and he wanted to know something more about me. I asked him when we would see each other again and he said he could be with me all this weekend.

Dear comrades, I did it! I did it! I'm as good as a silly goose but I did it! This is too good to be true, I just can't figure out what the hell I was getting into in the past!

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I took my balls, walked up to him, and asked him if he had time to talk. He agreed and we walked outside of the bookstore. I told him my name, age, and job. I told him I had a crush on him at first sight and invited him to go out with me. He blushed and looked very nervous. I gave him a note with my number on it while I told him he could text me if he agreed and then I left.

A little while later, I got texts from him asking where to go on a date and I told him I would take him to a Japanese restaurant. He told me he was free tonight so we could meet earlier.

I'm shaking right now. I have a date tonight!!!!!

Edit: I can't believe I'm getting so many comments, sorry it's hard for me to respond to them all, but **THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH**. I don't have many friends in life, and you guys are my best friends right now!

3,(22 F) Why does every guy my age want a threesome?? God it’s so fucking annoying! Men please share why you think that’s fun or attractive?!,"If one more guy asks me I might snap. A guy I’ve been talking to for a month asked me about myself and a friend last night; while ex boyfriends have brought it up in the past. To this recent guy, I said, “what if that was me asking about your friend” and he immediately said sorry. SO…….. why do so many guys want it, yet wouldn’t be cool with reversing the role? I don’t even want to but it makes more sense thinking about it that way.

Edit: Damn this blew up. Lol. I was not trying to shame people for liking that stuff. Just trying to get some insight into the male mind :)

Another edit: He knows I’ve been cheated on before. That I’m very loyal in nature. Said he DOESN’T care about sex that much.

4,She cancelled our date because of my zodiac sign,"I’m a bit thrown off by this, but I was cancelled on due to my zodiac sign. Throughout the week before work, I visit a coffee shop. I go practically every weekday, and I’ve been seeing the same barista there every morning. We seemed to click well with our small conversations, and after chatting with her for a few weeks, I decided to offer my number, since she was on the clock. She declined to take my number, but gave me her Snapchat. We chatted a bit on Snapchat and agreed to go on a date Friday. About an hour after that, she said she wouldn’t be able to go out with me because she saw on my snap profile that I was an Aries. She said she doesn’t date Aries but it was nice meeting me. 

Is this something that is common in the dating world? I’ve never been rejected over my zodiac sign before so it kinda surprised me.

5,"Ladies, sleeping with him on the first date or early on does not impact how he feels about you.","I’ve held out for several dates with men to show them I’m not easy and taken home men on the first night. After a few years of doing both, there seems to be almost no correlation between how soon you sleep with them and how seriously they take you.

6,Am I [M35] the asshole for giving a Irish Goodbye to my date [F37]?,"Matched with this lady on Hinge and the conversation went really well. She even said, ""I'd love to get to know you more."" So, I asked her if she was free last night and we agreed to meet up at 8. Says she's running late and we push the time back twice, we're now meeting at 9. 

I get to the bar, on time and text her, ""I'm here."" She tells me to go to the bar next door because that's where she's at now. *Weird, she really hyped up the place we agreed on, but okay.*  

I get there and there's a woman that looks like her. She's having a chat with with 3 older men (all in their mid 50's). Her and I lock eyes and I ask if she's Katie. She says ""yes"" and tells me to go get a drink. She then literally turns her back on me and continues talking to Old Guy #1. I try and make awkward conversation with Old Guy #2 to my right. I don't know these people, she didn't introduce me to any of them. Maybe they're her coworkers she ran into or something. For about 10 minutes my date just continues to ignore me. 

I excuse myself to go to the bar and order a drink. It's busy and it takes about 10 minutes to get my order. I walk back to the table and my date turns to me. We talk for about 2 minutes and then she turns her back to me again to talk to Old Guy #1. He's telling her a riveting story about his March Madness picks /s. I'm left staring at the back of this girl's head. 

For a bit of background, I don't struggle getting dates. I don't struggle getting second or third dates. I'm told I'm an affable, charming and attractive dude. Not that it really matters, but Old Guy #1 isn't a Roger Sterling gray-fox, he's more of a Cam Tucker. Never in my wildest dreams would I show up late, change plans without communicating and then ignore the person I actually made plans with. I would NEVER do that to a date. 

I drain my drink and give a good ol' Irish goodbye. On my way home I get a text from her asking me to come back. I respond by saying that a date with 3 random dudes I don't know was not the plan and that she literally turned her back on me. She replies saying, ""I'm not a shitty person. I don't even know these guys and they're old enough to be friends with my dad lol."" I respond by wishing her the best of luck finding what she's looking for and to have a good night. I go home, order a pizza and play video games. 

At the time it was pretty insulting to have my time wasted like that. Am I the asshole for taking off?",ti3d2p,5343,451,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ti3d2p/am_i_m35_the_asshole_for_giving_a_irish_goodbye/
7,I approached a guy at the bar today,"I (F) went for a drink alone tonight, saw a pretty good looking guy sitting with his friends, felt like talking to him so I mustered my courage, went to his table when he and his friends were kind of chilling on their own, not talking to each other. I asked ""Hi, I saw you from across the room and I just want to talk to you, do you mind?"", to which he said ""Sorry, I'm with my friends."". I smiled, said I got it and wish him a good night then went back to my table. I felt so proud of myself, like the fact that I tried asking him was all that matters, whether his answer was yes or no (though it'd have been better if it was a yes). I am neither bitter at rejection nor tormented with what-ifs and this feels so nice.

8,I’m a woman who gives men flowers and they love it,"Last night I (28F) went on a first date with a guy (29M) and I brought him a bouquet of flowers. He was flabbergasted and said no one’s ever given him flowers before. He kept looking at them, then at me and saying “I can’t believe you got me flowers!” And he spent the rest of the night grinning like a fool.

Many years ago I read an article/poll that said over 50% of straight men would actually enjoy getting flowers from a woman, and most of these men even had a favorite type of flower. Maybe it’s a power move on my part, but I’ve given a few different men flowers over the years and they all absolutely loved it.

Normalize giving men flowers.

9,Should I (23M) tell a girl (25F) I saw for three dates that it’s her looks that are making me end it?,"So I have gone on three dates with a girl from Bumble because she’s nice to me and we had interests in common. Since the beginning I wasn’t that much attracted to her physique, but I wanted to go on dates to see if there would be a spark that would make it worth it to pursue dating her even if I don’t find her very attractive.

That said, today I went on the third date and at the end of it, combined with the other two dates, I made up my mind that I didn’t want to go further with her. I proceeded to tell her because I thought it was better in person than over text. 

She kept pressuring me to know what it was that was problematic. I kept telling her that we just didn’t go along well enough for me to be still interested.

My question is: should I have been honest and told her that her looks were the reason? 

I don’t see the point in hurting her with such a statement, and frankly, I’m not Brad Pitt, therefore it could happen to me someday and it would hurt a lot to hear.",r8zcyi,4982,158,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/r8zcyi/should_i_23m_tell_a_girl_25f_i_saw_for_three/

11,Date got up and left in the middle of a sentence,"I am kind of in a state of shock right now, I have no idea what just happened. I was on a date with this girl, we had a couple drinks and had been talking for a couple of hours. She was in the middle of saying something then she looked up and just grabbed her phone and left the table 

She came back ten minutes later and was like “I’m going home, it was nice meeting you.”

I was like “uhhhh are you okay??” and she was like “what? Oh… yeah…” and she got up and left 

I really have no idea what to even think about what just happened. It wasn’t an instant love connection but it wasn’t anything “leave in the middle of a sentence” worthy. That’s never happened to me before

EDIT: She texted me a couple hours later apologizing. She said she just broke up with her ex a few weeks ago and he walked through the door with a new girl and she became very emotional and panicked and didn’t know what else to do but leave. She said she had a nice time though. I said I’ve been there before, and I wish her the best.

As a woman, I cannot recall the last time I regret saying something. There is a 90% chance he’ll flat out say yes, and if not he absolutely 100% will be appreciative. Every single guy I’ve ever talked to has said they would love a woman making the first move.

15,PSA for Men: STAY AWAY FROM DATING APPS IF YOU VALUE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH," **Long Post!!**

In this post, I'm going to talk about how dating apps destroy confidence and self esteem, and essentially dig a grave for yourself to hop right into.

First of all, let me make this assumption: You're an average looking guy. You're not the ugliest kid on the block.. but you're also not the giga chad at the gym. Just... average. If you were a 10/10, then this advice probably wouldn't apply to you, but most of us are average. That's what average means, most of us fall into that category.

You decide, ""You know what? I'm tired of being lonely. I'm creating a Tinder profile"". Little do you know, you've just signed yourself up for great disaster. And here's why:

Online dating apps are a LOSING game for *most* guys. You, most likely, will end up more lonely and sad than before! Start by looking at the statistics:

**OVER 75% of users on Tinder are male!**

Imagine you and 2 other guys approach the same girl to try to ask her out... how would that make you feel? Now.. imagine you go to some dating event... and there are 25 girls and 75 guys... and all the guys are competing for those girls... Do you feel confident in your abilities? Oh, and let's pretend that 7.5 of those guys are extremely good looking (10%, I pulled that number out of my ass. I can't find the statistic to how many guys on tinder get a ton of swipes, but I'd guess the number is 10%).

And as a result, here are some of the things that can happen:

1. You don't get any matches (or a very few amount).
2. The matches that you do get, the girls don't really respond. Even after you spend an hour searching for the best pickup line, they just don't bite.
3. If they do respond, they'll probably disappear after a while

And what's the end result of this?: **You feel so shitty.** You ask, ""Why aren't girls responding to me?"", ""Why aren't I getting any matches?"", ""Am I really ugly or something?"". And all of a sudden, subconsciously, your self esteem and confidence PLUMMET. You think, ""If girls aren't swiping on me on a dating app, then how will I EVER be able to pick up a girl in real life?"". Your confidence takes a massive hit...

and worst of all:

It's not even true! You're not ugly, you're a good guy, and you do deserve it! The issue is, the numbers are so heavily stacked against you! That same girl that you spent an hour thinking of the perfect first message, is probably getting messages from 50+ other guys at the same moment. She probably didn't even see your message!

Just read this excerpt from an article where a guy created a fake woman's profile to see what it was like, ""\[Thomas\] made a profile of a girl named Simone and viola! Three days later, he had already received over 400 messages which indeed were an eye-opener for Thomas.""

**400 messages in three days.** But because you were under the impression that she thought you were ugly... your confidence now tanked.

Conclusion: Stay away from online dating apps. It's a slippery slope for men, and you can suffer a drastic hit on your self esteem and confidence, thus making the probability of you meeting a girl even slimmer. **You have MUCH better odds cold approaching a girl at the library, than downloading some shitty dating app**. Instead of the above example of 3 guys approaching 1 girl... it's 1 guy approaching 1 girl. I like those odds, what about you?

And.. if you get rejected in real life, normally the girl is really kind about it: ""I have a boyfriend"", or ""I'm not interested"". That is a lot easier to cope with, rather than being ghosted by countless girls on an app. And, just approaching the girl in the first place is a confidence booster!

**TLDR**: Over 75% of the users on Tinder are male. If you're an average looking guy, your odds of success are slim. As a result, you will most likely experience very few matches/responses from girls. This can directly impact your self esteem, confidence, and mental health because it gives the perception that girls think you're ugly... when it's not true in fact. They're just bombarded with hundreds of messages from other guys. You have better odds cold approaching girls, and even rejection can still lead to a boost in confidence because hey... you tried, most don't.",sq4ugu,4282,400,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sq4ugu/psa_for_men_stay_away_from_dating_apps_if_you/

I have been talking to a guy (21) and we had our third date at my place last night. We had mutually agreed days beforehand that the deed was probably gonna happen and it did. During the first three minutes, the guy slaps me on the face and my eyes widen and my mouth opens in shock, and before I could muster out a word, he slaps me again 3x harder. The sound it made made my body revolt and I sat up and proceeded to have a panic attack. My date looked confused and apologized but his excuse was that i was okay with choking but my appearance looked like “I was the type to enjoy it rough”. The rest of the night was off and he even seemed disappointed that I didn’t want to have sex with him before we went to bed.

It was super embarrassing and I feel bad. There was blood everywhere and his sheets are definitely destroyed.

He was really chill about it but of course it was kind of a mood killer.

What should I do?

21,He made me go half on the first date,"I (24F) met this guy on hinge (32M) and he invited me out to dinner. He chose the time and place. We made it there and it was a 30 min wait so he suggested getting a drink at a bar across the street. 

We ended up getting our appetizer there too since the wait was a bit long.  I offered to pay for the drinks ( didn’t think he would let me) but he said it’s ok I could pay for the next (dinner I guess !?!). The drinks and appetizer was 45, he paid.

We made it to dinner and it rounded up to about 70, I paid.

This is extremely unattractive to me only because it was a first date. He knew he would get me to pay for dinner and ordered MORE appetizers and lots of extras. 
He chose the place and initiated the date but I ended up paying.

Outside of this the conversation was ok.
Honestly the monetary portion of the date threw me off and was pretty gross to me. I’ve never had that happen.

He texted me but I haven’t texted back, I think I’m no longer interested.

23,Lost my virginity and feel horrible,"Lost virginity and feel horrible, It was just awful. I was crying after and idk what's wrong with me. I’m sick right now my neck and full body hurts. He came down to our
house so we could wal dog outside and watch the sunset. We went back to his house to grab his friend for their soccer game. before that though he basically pushed me down on his dick when he knew i wasnt feeling well. He was so rough and choking and spanking me. and like 2 min later like threw us off the bed to go to his game. it's my fault bc i never verbalized no and i also allowed it. It takes two to tango but I guess I expected him to treat me more respectfully or make sure it was a loving and caring experience. it was the opposite. he left me to cry. it felt like crap bc he was so rough when im that sick and then like we had to leave right away. Just a horrible and not a caring way to experience sex for the first time. 

“I needed it,” he said but it’s my body not his and his forced it and his knows it. I feel violated and used. 

And all I get from him is
“you’re not really a virgin,” and 
“what do you want me to say,” and,
“so you don’t want to talk huh?” and 
“Thanks for giving it to me.” 
Like it’s no big deal to him. 

The more I think about it the more upset and angry I feel. He knew how I felt about virginity and how special it was. I feel so much regret and emptiness. I feel so alone and I don't know what to do, we've been dating six months. He was selfish and he ruined that first experience for me. He made me feel like all the years I spent holding onto something special were wasted,
like they meant nothing. 
He doesn't respect how incredibly hard it was for me to maintain that piece of myself and for it to happen that way. He even called me after saying how much he regrets what happened and how guilty he feels. He said he wishes he could take it back, he said I'm sorry for going to the game after. I told him I need space to process what happened. I don't know what to do

TLDR: boyfriend of six months took my virginity and i feel worthless. both in our early 20's. He isn't a virgin and was sick of waiting, he always brought up how it was damaging our relationship and he needed it. i always made sure to help with other things because i knew how it affected him. Didn't comfort me at all about the situation and fought with me on the ride home

24,I didn’t enjoy my first time,"24 M, I hooked up with a girl last night and she knew this was my first time. She was very kind and tried to keep me comfortable. She was able to get to the orgasm as well. But I couldn’t cum and i feel it might have to do with the fact that watching porn has set unreal standards in my head. 
She wants to meet again. I’m confused as I don’t know how common is it for a guy to not cum on his first time. 
Should I meet her again and try once more? Or should I message her that I need to take a break from sex?

25,Do guys ever fantasize about women in a loving type of way or is it always sexual,"What I mean is… if I find a guy attractive and interesting, I, as a women, naturally gravitate towards fantasizing about love/ the depth and mystery of the person.

26,Why it's important to have female friends as a single guy,"Okay so tonight I was hanging out with my friends at a local bar when a group of 4 girls stationed themselves rather close to us. My friends were all taken and had their S.Os with them except myself being single. Naturally they were egging me on to make a move on the cutest girl of the bunch. Approaching a group of girls that large is quite daunting so I was quite reserved up until one of my friend's girlfriend we'll call her Ashley informs me that she had noticed the cutest girl of the group throwing glances at me and I should definitely talk to her.

I noticed those looks too but didn't think much of it cause we were close to the group and I simply assumed she was just looking in my general direction so it didn't register to me that she may have been interested in me up until Ashley pointed that out to me. So I decided why not? And waved at her. She waved back with a really cute smile and then gestured to Ashley in a way as if she was non verbally asking if we were together. Ashley responded by pointing to her boyfriend and the cute girl nods in return. 

I looked to my friend wondering what just happened. She laughably goes ""she thought we were together and I just pointed to Jake soooo now you HAVE to go talk to her or you're gonna break that cute girl's heart"". I grabbed my drink and approached her. Here's were the real fun begins.

Her: ""You guys aren't together??""

Me: ""No no that's my friend. Her boyfriend is right there.""

Her: ""Ohhh okay! Like I didn't wanna entertain anything while your girlfriend is standing literally next to you haha!""

Me: ""Yeah no you're fine. Honestly I wouldn't even be talking to you right now if it weren't for her. I just didnt think you'd be interested.""

Her: ""Well I assumed you two were together. I was trying to be slick about it but obviously failed miserably haha""

This is the very reason why I think it's important to have female friends, especially if you are single. They have a keen eye in noticing hints that women toss towards men since they do the exact same thing! It's much easier for them to spot it on the fly.

**Edit: For those asking why I didn't immediately text her, I made this post very late at night. I have since texted her and waiting for a response. I'll make an update soon. Thanks for the funny replies** 😁

**Edit: Some of you wondered why I used the word female but not male under the same context. I wrote this late at night and it just went over my head. My apologies**

**Update: She texted me back but doesn't believe i am single... not sure what to do now lol**

**TLDR: Females are good at spotting hints that other females throw at men who they find attractive. Going out with female friends when single will allow you to have an easier time spotting those hints through their lenses**",u4urjo,3507,208,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/u4urjo/why_its_important_to_have_female_friends_as_a/

In the past I have def tried to make plans with women i was interested in and have been told Im just ""busy"". Turns out, nothing ever happened with them. Probably cuz they were not interested and just being nice and trying not to reject me. 

Fast forward to my current situation, There is a girl Im seeing, and she really is busy as hell, just started a brand new career working 12 hrs shifts, has her kids 3 days a week, and is eating right, hitting the gym, and going thru therapy working on her depression/issues. She has told me she cant hang due to work or having the kids, but the words ""too busy"" have never came out of her mouth and she is finding/making time to hang out with me, or even just something simple like playing a silly game online together for 30 minutes. Ppl will make time for ppl they are interested in. 

Too bad my brain keeps trying to convince me otherwise due to my traumas and issues. But Im trying and keeping that all to myself cuz I know its my issue.

29,Why hasn't he kiss me?,"I (32F) met a lovely man on Tinder (35M) and hit it off immediately. We have gone on about 5 dates lasting at the minimum 6 hours each. He texts me every single morning with a good morning video. He checks in multiple times in the day. He is always saying how he's thinking about me and wants to spend time with me. He has sent me flowers and is a total gentleman but.... He hasn't made a single move. Not even hand holding. He will hug me a lot but that's all. I'm so confused and I'm afraid to mess it up by moving faster than he wants to. Why hasn't he kissed me??? or even gotten close? I'm worried I'm friend zoned. I really like him. How do I move things along without freaking him out?


Edit: You all are right… I shouldn’t be waiting on him to make the move I have two lips as well. He’s the first person that has made me butterfly nervous and shy ever. I guess I was just worried that I would mess things up (which as one commenter mentioned is what he might be worried about as well). This is my first time single in 10+ years and a lot has changed (me too for instance),so tomorrow when we make dinner together I’m just going to do it. I’ll update you all after. Thank you guys so much for the advice.

Edit2: The date is tomorrow January 15th and I’ll update right after.

Update: I kissed him!!! I just came home from our 15hr date. While making dinner I asked him why he hasn’t tried to kiss me. He said he wanted to make sure I was comfortable with it and said that he was worried he might mess things up between us if I didn’t want to kiss him back. That he was having such a great time with me he didn’t want to chance turning me off…And like most of you predicted he then asked “well why didn’t you try and kiss me?” I responded with I really want to kiss him and I asked him if I could and then I did.

(Otherwise the post would ended up being too long. Recommend you go to that post before reading this one)

I'm so happy, she is my girlfriend now.

I didn't gave her an ultimatum, I just told her how the situation made me feel and she deleted her OF.


 I told her that a part of me was insecure of starting a relationship with her but another part of me felt it was unfair to make her change for me.


 Then she told me that she had no idea how I was feeling and that I should have told her before. 
 She told me that I changed some behaviours I had that made her feel insecure (like talking to two of my ex-girlfriends) and she reminded me how important and valuable I am and that her OF isn't even close to be important. 

 I was afraid of having to let her go. I feel so relieved now... Remember to always communicate your insecurities with your partner, don't be afraid of the outcome.

 So happy ending I think.

35,Don’t Forget to Date Yourself,"Today I(27f) took myself on a date to the local zoo alone (I am single). I took my little head phones, got a beer or two, enjoyed a lunch, some ice cream, beautiful weather, a cute souvenir, and for the first time ever I got to see nearly all the animals. I’ve been going to this zoo all my life and never had this experience, usually it’s pretty miserable and I can’t stand it. 

Though at times I had people look at me, it didn’t feel bad or awkward. I’m happy I took myself out for once. I didn’t wait on someone to go with me, whether that be friends or some guy. I treated myself and I felt and feel great. 

My advice is to take yourself out and enjoy yourself. Don’t wait on others. Life is too short to be waiting. Plus, you may meet your person at one of the places you treat yourself too! But please go out and enjoy yourself. Don’t be afraid. Next stop is a theme park alone once it opens up for the summer!

39,You talk yourself out of sex when you bring it up too soon.,"Please respect a person's boundaries. 

I get it. We all love to get it in. But unless the other person has stated they're only looking for something casual, talking about sex too soon will most likely ruin your chances at getting any. 

I just started talking to a new guy and it was going okay until he said he couldn't wait to give me head. I asked not to talk about sex or anything intimate until we've met. He kept going. 

""I'm not that type of guy. It's hard not to talk about it because you're so pretty. I can get sex from anyone. If all I wanted was sex you would know. I'm not like all those other guys.""

Okay so why keep bringing it up? Continuing to bring it up means:

- you have no respect for my boundaries

- you're only interested in sex with me

- you ARE DEFINITELY like the other guys

- you aren't safe to be around because you care more about what you want vs what is comfortable for both of us.

- after POST NUT CLARITY, you're going to have a ""realization"" that you didn't want a relationship and the girl shouldn't have expected it BLA BLA BLA.

My advice: respect a person's boundaries. It's not hard.

Me and this guy DON'T talk anymore. My purpose here is to remind everyone RESPECT SOMEONE'S BOUNDARIES. Yes I easily cut him off, but that DOESN'T excuse his pushy and rude behavior. There are people like that who have harmed others because they couldn't get what they want.

This advice will never go out of style.

EDIT: I'm not saying talking about sex is bad. I'm saying if you really want to get to know someone, you need to respect their boundaries and be honest about what you're really looking for.

43,Your Significant Other is a direct reflection of your self respect.,"I’m sorry but too many people come to this sub and tell their situation with their SO and it’s ridiculous how a lot of people don’t understand how their self respect and self worth ties into relationships. I’m mainly speaking to my girls here bc I’ve noticed that men are very quick to leave a woman where she got him fucked up at.

Y’all give your SO many chances at disrespecting you but you know that if it was one of your friends, you would have been cut them off. How do you think you look when your man consistently calls you out of your name and you haven’t put him in his place the very first time he started that shit? You let one thing slide and they’ll start ice skating. What the fuck do you mean by your man has cheated on you and you’re still staying in that relationship?! If a man cheats on me, that’s a straight up ghost from my end. He’ll never see me again.

When it comes to acts of disrespect that he commits the first time, and you don’t see it as valid enough to break up with him immediately, PUT THAT MAN IN HIS PLACE RIGHT THEN AND THERE. Let him know that if he was to ever try that shit again, you’re out. This doesn’t count for cheating. If a man cheats, you must leave that relationship immediately with no hesitation. If you don’t live with him and you don’t have any ties to him, straight up ghost. Especially if he doesn’t know that you know about his cheating. You don’t owe him an explanation for why you left. His presence should absolutely repulse you if he’s a cheater.

It hurts when I see women settle for less. Babes, fix how you view yourself. Stop inviting random people to singlehandedly mess up your life. Have boundaries and be extremely quick to leave when he serves you no purpose but is rather draining you. I want better for all my girls this year. Y’all need to do better.

45,Date went on a fat shame rant. Need help with responding,"So I had a very strange dating experience and I don’t know how to respond to this person? And I really want to…so help me out here! 

I (31f) matched with this person (35m)on bumble and he came down to see me (we live in different cities). I could tell he is very into me right away and he knows a lot of things about me -the details of which I dint necessarily share with him…my work/which other cities I work in/a little bit about my family/he found out we had common friends and asked them for my number…I found this a bit strange but decided to overlook it. We had a normal first date. 

Our second date became really strange. We met over dessert and he went off on a nutritional rant about how sugar is basically poison…all while I was eating a piece of cake. He then went on about how the concept of body positivity is trash and every “fat person” is unhappy. It was horrific for me to hear. I’m a fit and healthy person, I weigh 123lbs and I’m 5’5 so I dint get where this was coming from? He then told me it wasn’t directed at me because he won’t go on a date with someone who isn’t fit. I feel very objectified and strange. It gives me very “you’re not like other girls” type of a vibe. I couldn’t articulate my views fully because I’m very non confrontational. 

After the date, he kept texting me to make plans to meet again. I brought up the “fat”rant that he went on to which he replied “I think you’re doing well but if you gain weight, that’s a problem. Please don’t get fat 😬” 

I literally do not care for his validation or his awful views and I need help drafting a reply that isn’t rude but stern. This is so outrageous! I can’t believe it.

*Edit*: Woah! This blew up. 

I have decided to ignore/ghost him. I don’t want to engage with this behavior and get into arguments etc. not worth it. But some of the suggested responses are hilarious! Thank you! 

I don’t think it’s about his preference of dating fit women being the problem. But how he put down and spoke condescendingly about a certain section of people. That’s unnecessary. He could’ve just kept it to his preferences. I don’t think life is as black and white as being fat/skinny. I’ve had body issues in the past…I was bulimic for a very long time; I’ve not eaten for days altogether and went about my life with body aches and dizziness and that’s another reason why it triggered me I think. It’s been a year since I’ve recovered and not judge my body for it’s size but to strive to be Healthy. Also it’s just super judgey, man…gaining/losing weight isn’t just about fitness-there are so many other factors in life that influence it. 

About the stalking- I asked him why he went to the lengths to do all this digging to which he said he’s just “curious”. I think he wanted me to feel impressed by how much he’s pursuing me? It’s only in my therapy session did I realize this is stalker-ish behavior. Jeez. 

About how he looks- He’s not fat but he says he hasn’t been to the gym in a couple of years and that this is the unhealthiest/fattest he has been. 

Thank you everyone for your input and help and support! I think my reaction isn’t an exaggeration. His attitude is terrible and I think its just so random to tell your date the second time you meet them to not get fat and rant about sugar while on a dessert date.",t6terp,2757,529,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/t6terp/date_went_on_a_fat_shame_rant_need_help_with/
46,We had bad sex on the first date and she ghosted me after.,"I went on 2 dates with a girl. On the second date, she invited me to hers and we had sex. 

**Edit: in the title I said first date but I meant to say second 

Admittedly, I wasn’t very good because it was only my second time having sex and I was nervous. That being said, it wasn’t **awful**, it just wasn’t good. We made out, I engaged in foreplay - I fingered her and ate her out (but I probably wasn’t very good since I’d never done these before). We then had sex. I lost my erection twice but I gained it back as we swapped positions. We finished by fingering her again and making out. 

She ghosted me the next day and it’s been 3.5 weeks since I heard from her despite reaching out.

I don’t feel good at all about myself right now

1. All my past dating experiences have basically been rejections after the first date or just a lack of interest in a first date at all 
2. I’ve never had a girl I like actually like me back - this was the first time even if it was just 2 dates it really hurt to just be ghosted.
3. I’m obviously feeling very insecure right now. It was my second time having sex so I didn’t expect to be amazing. I had a random Tinder hookup once over a year ago which I didn’t learn anything from. 

Has anyone ever had anything similar happen to them? What would you do to try and stay confident? 

Honestly, any stories or advice would help right now. I feel really bad, embarrassed and unconfident and I don’t have anyone else to ask.",sqtesg,2749,597,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sqtesg/we_had_bad_sex_on_the_first_date_and_she_ghosted/
47,Dating as a man is so expensive,"Just got into the dating world for the first time (I've been in relationships but never been in a ""dating lifestyle."")

Fuck its expensive.

I've got 3 dates this week (I know, humble brag, but that's not the point). It makes me realize how low investment it is for the girls. I'm not blaming women at all, I realize this is just how it works and none of us got to decide how society is set up. But seriously, I've got to pick the place and *pay.* These girls just get to show up for free and decide if they like me.

If none of these girls work out, or if they just realize they don't like me, it's like oh well at least they had a good time. For me its like fuck I just spent $300 on people I'm never going to see again.

Anyone got some advice on low-cost dates that are fun but a little cheaper for a first date? I was thinking of like rock climbing or something.",wdmfdl,2644,380,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wdmfdl/dating_as_a_man_is_so_expensive/

Then he wanted to bring me a drink. So I had to tell him no, yet again.

But asking the entire gender why all the ones you’ve met are that way will not accomplish anything. I don’t know what those other men are thinking. My girlfriend doesn’t know why the women you meet think that way.

Because regardless of your experiences, there are a lot of men who would love to help their woman get off. There are lots of women who are a head taller than you guys who think you’re more than good enough.

53,Is friends with benefits a lie? Or am I just creating my own problems because I eat them out?,"The last 4 women I’ve casually “dated” have all ended up falling in love with me in a short period of time. This happens despite me being very clear about not wanting anything serious from the start. As soon as they confess love for me, I stop seeing them because I don’t want to lead them on.

All 4 situations went like this…. Hung out a couple times (drinks, dinner, concerts etc) without any sex. By the 3rd or 4th date, we’re having sex and I go always down on these women because I’m into getting them off. That will last for two or three months before they admit to being in love with me. It sucks because I’m breaking their hearts and then I have to find someone else to casually date. It’s frustrating and I feel like a jerk.

To add some more context, I take them on dates, I usually pay the bill, open the door for them, complement them, and we do cool shit together. To top it off, I am a religious clam licker and think this may have something to do with my problem but who knows. Even though I have been overly clear about my intentions, I can see how they may interpret all of this as the old saying “Actions speak louder than words”.

My goal is to continue casual dating without breaking hearts so what should I do differently?


EDIT: I’ve learned that this isn’t everyone’s definition of FWB. Majority rules says this is dating. Majority rules also says it’s probably not the licking the bean that’s causing the problems….. New question….. Seafood buffet aside, is there a middle ground between dating and friends with benefits? I.e. dating with no strings attached? There has to be people out there who want the same thing that I do…… I can’t be the only one out here on oyster island.

54,"If you don’t work on your insecurities, you will burn every partner you have to the ground.","You’ll always be expecting constant communication, reassurance, attention, praise. You’ll demand that you see each other more, talk more, go on more dates. You’ll keep testing them, manipulating them, to make them prove to you that they love you. And no matter what, it’ll never be enough; because you’re expecting them to fill a hole that you’re too afraid to do the hard work to fill yourself. 

On the flip side, they’ll get burned out, wondering why, even with all they do, that “it’s not enough”. There’s only so many hours in a day to work, sleep, fulfill their basic daily needs, and they’re going to get resentful that you’re demanding of more and more of their energy, time, space, and money; like you’re trying to control them.

Far too many people who are emotionally immature/unable to cope with unhealthy thinking patterns are out there dating because they think someone else can “complete them”. And it’s going to destroy relationships and leave both parties resentful and jaded.

56,Guy I was talking to initiated sex and then got mad after I had sex with him,"i (19f) had been talking to this guy (19m) for a month and a half. we had both expressed a lot of interest in each other and even though we hadn't explicitly talked about it i was under the impression he wanted a relationship.

the last time i saw him, we started drinking and one thing led to the next. like the title says, he initiated things and was honestly way more into it than i was. not to say that i wasn't into it, i was just hesitant since it was our first time together.

i went home that night upset that i had allowed that to happen. i hadn't wanted to have sex that soon and was worried it may have ruined things. i told him how i felt and he reassured me that everything was fine and that he liked me just as much as he had before. and everything WAS fine until yesterday.

i could tell something was off so i decided to ask him what his intentions were. not only did he tell me he didn't want a relationship (and was confused how i even thought he did), he had apparently also been upset that we had had sex that soon but decided to COMPLETELY BLAME ME for it. 

in his own words, he said if i hadn't rushed having sex with him there was a possibility we could've dated but since i had, the possibility was gone. as if he wasn't the one that came onto me?? **as if sex isn't a 2 person act??**

he refused to accept his participation in it, repeatedly saying he had never wanted it to happen and that he just didn't know how to say no. mind you this guy is at least twice my size, so it's not like i had any power over him. he also initiated every single thing we did and was praising me the whole time, so he never showed any signs of not being into it.

i'm just completely blindsided and shocked that he would act as if i forced him into doing something when he came onto me in that way and i told him almost immediately after that i was upset it had happened. i feel like it's obvious that he's manipulating and gaslighting me but i just don't get why, everything was going so good it's like a switch just went off in his head

this is definitely one of the more fucked up things that has happened to me recently and i just don't really know how to feel. any support would be appreciated LOL

59,Got maced.,"
As the post says, I (27m) got maced tonight. First time and it sucks. I got invited to go out with a couple coworkers. I’m not a big drinker, had 1 drink and was completely sober. Well one of my coworkers is a regular and knows a bit about the people that go. 

Anyways, on to where I get maced. I noticed a cute woman with a group of 3 other girls. I’m not the type to stare and ogle at if anything I take a quick glance at someone I find attractive but l addressed to my buddy that hey, she is pretty cute. So they help me muster up my courage to walk over and introduce myself. And it takes A LOT to put myself around new people.

My exact words were, “excuse me, but my nam..” and instantly got hit in the face with mace. Painful and absolutely embarrassing.

I don’t even know what I did. I never touched anyone, said anything or suggested anything vulgar, I honestly don’t know. Why did this happen? I don’t know what I did wrong.

(Edit) the person in question I was attempting to speak to was not the one who maced me, but rather one of their colleagues blind sided me.

Also, I’m unaware of what their group was dealing with this evening and maybe my approach was the final straw or something. But I approached her from an angle that didn’t come off like I was cornering her and could be seen, kept more than an arms length distance in a somewhat crowded place, I didn’t pester or badger her for attention, had she ignored my “excuse me” I would’ve just walked away and I certainly didn’t lay my hands on her or her colleagues at any point or linger around for more than a minute. I felt like what I did would be appropriate to approach someone.

*(UPDATE 8/24: I did not expect the post to get popular like it did and I appreciate the helpful info I was given. To answer some questions; yes the police were called right after the incident happened. Yes there were witnesses to what had happened. The bar was not packed but had a fair amount of people because it was a Tuesday night. 

I consulted a family member who’s a bar member and they’re going to find an attorney who would support my case. I was advised to visit a urgent care for a checkup and try to get prescribed eye drops and try to prevent any possible permanent damage to my eyes as well as find out if I was for sure sprayed with mace, pepper spray, or some other chemical. I was also told I can’t be promised anything serious would come out if it for a number of reasons including that most bars and clubs cameras don’t have the best if any audio and anything I said may or may not be audible because most bars are noisy environments and to expect them to fight back if they’re even caught. I can try to have the bar give me a copy of the footage and if they won’t give it to me I have to get a subpoena for it. I called the local police department that came out yesterday and I didn’t get much info but they will have someone contact me in the near future about the incident. At this point my main concern is if I get video with no audible audio, it’ll turn to a “he said and she said” situation. 

Lastly, this post was never meant to gain any sort of pity or legal advice. I was originally wondering if i did something wrong when I’m trying to get back into dating since I’m fully against dating apps. I honestly thought the incident would get brushed under the rug and would move on from it. This isn’t a post to label women bad either. Please don’t bring a misogynistic mentality into a conversation because you’re unhappy with your own experiences.",ww8f4e,2410,713,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ww8f4e/got_maced/

Online I don’t advertise my background, lifestyle, financial status. But when my matches ask what I’m looking for a do mention someone worldly, educated, well traveled. 

I say I’m looking for someone intellectual, educated worldly and suddenly it’s stop “chasing the top men”, “oh you only care about his income”, “wEll wHat dO yOu BrIng tO tHe tAble”. Which in my specific case is especially laughable as I have no need for his money.  

We are allowed to be attracted to whoever we are attracted to. I realize that means I’ll likely be single forever (per my last post) but it doesn’t make me a gold digger.

70,Please tell me I'm not the only woman who loses attraction to a guy who wants to have sex with other people while dating me.,"Maybe it's because I started dating late (in my 20s), but I only date men who make me happy and feel secure. And the only men who make me feel that way are guys who are totally, 100% into me (which I count as making me a dating and sexual priority i.e. monogamous sex). They're typically guys who make it clear they're not seeing anyone else very early on. I've had very healthy relationships with men as a result. No man I've dated has made me feel insecure or upset with him for his sexual habits.

The one guy who tried to get me to have non-monogamous sex with him (he was dating one other person and banging her), I was clear to him that I would NEVER have non-monogamous sex in my life and swiftly left on the spot when it was clear no compromise could be made. I believe I deserve monogamous sex. It's like a basic, basic requirement for me and for those women reading this who care about monogamy and are bothered by guys sleeping around, it should be a basic requirement for you too! I'm so much happier and relaxed while dating now.

Here are my thoughts: different people have different relationships with sex. I get that. Men tend to skew closer to polygamy than women, but on average I'd say most people (both genders) want monogamy eventually. If a guy doesn't want to try monogamy with me or if he tries to prolong the dating process unnecessarily long or is in anyway avoidant about commitment, I absolutely do not want anything to do with him.

If you are so upset about this that you are making a post on reddit or complaining to your friends, I have news for you: that man is not the one for you. I'm sorry, but if he's not making you super excited and happy and secure in yourself and your sexuality, YOU KICK HIM TO THE CURB.

Now, if you are a woman/man who genuinely enjoys sleeping around and exploring sexuality with multiple people, you do you! But also, you should date similar types of people and avoid getting involved with people who are clearly uncomfortable with you sleeping around",syy330,2286,485,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/syy330/please_tell_me_im_not_the_only_woman_who_loses/
71,Is it ok to become boyfriend and girlfriend after a week or two?,"I met a girl on tinder about two weeks ago. I asked her out as soon as I possibly could. We spent about 8 hours together on the first night. By the second date she had met one of my good friends. Third date I met her parents by happenstance and we opened up to each other about past relationships. Fourth date she met my parents and now she’s my date to my brother wedding on Sunday. 

At no point during this process did I ever feel forced to do something or even slightly uncomfortable. We have a ton in common. We started giving each other music recommendations as we both sing and play guitar but have super different tastes in music. 

Tonight I was dropping her off at her car and I just kinda felt like I wanted to call her my girlfriend and so I asked her and she said yes. 

It feels right to me. She hasn’t shown a single red flag. Her family is super nice. She gets along fantastically with my family. Talks about me all the time to her coworkers and family and I do the same. 

I’ve been in a relationship where I felt forced to progress quicker than I was comfortable with and this is not that. She gave me several outs as to moving too fast and I didn’t really feel the need to slow it down. Is it stupid to ask her so soon even though it has felt absolutely natural this entire time?",uyr0h1,2280,254,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/uyr0h1/is_it_ok_to_become_boyfriend_and_girlfriend_after/

73,The most WTF first date of my life,"So I downloaded Tinder and matched to this very attractive guy, we chat for a few days and he even called me a couple of times before we agreed to meet in person, he wanted to pick me up at my house but I preferred to see him at the place we would go. 
Everything was perfect, he was acting like a gentleman and the conversation was really good, I invited him to a party, introduced him to a couple of friends and after a while he kissed me, I responded the kiss, but then he started to get a little handsy and I had to keep moving his hands up, he asked me to go with him to a bar where “he used to work” I agreed only if we were back to the party later, so he took me to this bar and it turns out it was a male stripper bar, so he used to be a stripper, we left back to the party, but he said he wanted to pee and asked me to get close to him as if we were just talking and then he proceeded to take his D out and pee right on the street, next to a car 😳 then he tried to do the same again outside of the party but I stopped him and asked him please not to.
Finally, he takes me back to get my car but before that he goes into a motel without even asking me, I said hey what are you doing!? He said what? let’s go inside for just an hour, I insisted him to please get me back to where my car was, and he was pushing me to go to the motel only to “sleep” if I didn’t want to do anything else, I was mortified telling him several times that I didn’t want to, so he finally turned around and he was visibly annoyed and I was completely in shock, I told him he should’ve asked me first if I wanted to go there, I said I never sleep with anyone on a first date and he said that we were adults and there were no rules for that, I guess I just don’t understand how a person can be such a gentleman and then change so much afterwards and be so pushy, and the peeing thing next to me on the street... that’s just so weird, I’m so confused 🤯

EDIT I: For those who kind of excuse his behavior by saying “hey it’s Tinder, a hooking up app, what did you expect” he’s also in Bumble, so, the platform really doesn’t matter much, none of our previous chats and phone conversations had a single hint of something sexual, he didn’t even asked me for more pictures, he acted like he was genuinely interested in what I had to say and not on the looks, I understand now it was a facade but definitely not the fact that it was Tinder or I was only led to his looks only.",tj5mrr,2257,285,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tj5mrr/the_most_wtf_first_date_of_my_life/
74,Is it a red flag that a guy demanded I do my eyebrows before a date?,"I’ve been messaging with a guy and because I was busy the day he wanted to hang out this is what he said word to word:

“At least we’ll have time to make ourselves beautiful and we won’t embarrass ourselves. When I see a girl with a little moustache showing, untrimmed, eyebrows, nails and etc I go crazy. I cannot be doing more self care than her. Or with dirty shoes. Minimal hygiene is required”

Sorry if translation is bad. My question is because I feel like he shouldn’t be telling me to shave my eyebrows. I don’t shave my whole body except for my face so is what he said considered a red flag?


EDIT: Thank you everyone for commenting. I’m trying to read and reply to all of the comments. I messaged him saying how it’s inappropriate what he said. He started talking about how hair stops growing on the body but not on the head and how it’s aesthetically more pleasant to have less hair to which I replied that I find more hair more attractive. He said he expects women to have less hair on their arms than him to which I replied I don’t shave my arms/legs. 

Then he said he was joking yesterday, how everyone can do whatever they want, he’s just commenting and everyone has different opinions about the world and not to take his words too seriously, how he’s more blunt but always has good feelings and etc.

People ""notice"" you simply because you're alive. People can't necessarily notice you looking at someone in a ""lovely"" way. Even if, it's not specifically a boy's job to ask out a girl who is more into him.

77,Boyfriend exchanging NSFW messages with male best friend,"
I'm (F) dating this guy for 4 months now but he has been in my friend group for almost a year already.

He became close to my male best friend because they started taking extra classes at the same course. Everything was fine and we were all good friends, but one day the conversation about bdsm came up and we took the online test, it turned out me and this friend had the % for sub really high and my bf had the dom on the top. I think it went down hill from there.

After a couple weeks my best friend came to tell me that they were doing this type of ""friendship dynamic"" where my boyfriend orders my best friend around. At first i just found it funny and didn't care about it much. My friend said this included filling his waterbottle everytime he told him to, always bringing him coffee in the morning or carrying his stuff. I then asked if there were more things involved, like romantic feelings or sexual desire, my friend assured me it had nothing to do with that and it was just because he likes to be ordered around.
After that I talked to my boyfriend and he said the same thing and that besides all that he was sure about being straight and that he loved me. I trusted both of them and just forgot about the subject, my friend even hooked up with some guys in the mean time. 

HOWEVER, one day, when me and my boyfriend were getting ready to go out with said friend, he asked if i could text him trough his phone to confirm the time we would meet (because he was in the bathroom). I did, but then i felt the curiosity to roll up the conversation and saw it was way more than what they were telling me. My boyfriend made him do his homework, asked for pictures of him wearing women clothes and makeup, pictures kneeling down in said clothes and demanded he called him ""sir"". There were also messages like ""you've been dissobeying me lately"" or ""if you improve your behaviour you'll get a reward"" (never mentioning what type of reward it is) and he also called him names like ""little bitch"". There's probably more, i couldn't roll farther up (still looking for a opportunity to do so). When I think about it, i don't think something physical, like sex, actually happened between them, but now im in doubt if it would if they had the opportunity. My mind says it wouldn't.

I feel really betrayed by the two people i trusted the most and don't know what to do. If I tell my boyfriend he would know i went trough his messages. If I tell my friend the friendship would most likely be over. 

I don't think i should let this slide but i want to learn more before doing anything. I don't know what to feel or exactly what to do and would like some outside opinions.

We sat on the couch talking for hours while casually sipping red wine the whole time we were touching on eachother, she insisted I stay the night. We made our way to the bedroom and she excused herself to go get more wine. She came back to the room with the bottle wearing nothing but a thong. The sex was amazing and she really knew what she was doing with her mouth. We went for a couple of rounds and then chatted until we decided to sleep, during our conversation I complimented her head game and told her that usually I don't enjoy receiving oral (as I get off more from giving) and said that she was one of the few that got me really enjoying it. She asked if It'd be okay if she could taste me in the morning as a way to get me up. I woke up to morning head and then we messed around a few more times.

However my boyfriend has a bit of a temper especially when things don’t go his way and he wanted to take me to a park then and there and have sex. I kept opposing and got flustered that he’d bring it up so much. He proceeded to call me ‘lame’ and just get sassy and standoffish with me. We were headed home and my heart sank to my stomach when he took a wrong turn. We pulled over and immediately started telling him i didn’t want to have sex and he told me to ‘chill the fuck out’ and that we were just going for a walk. We ended up behind this building and he started touching me. I didn’t say no but i didn’t stop him. We did end up having sex and immediately after i felt so dirty and gross about myself. I just know that i didn’t want him mad at me because that verbally never goes well. Thinking about it now a few hours later it gives me a wave of anxiety and makes me want to close my eyes and shrink up. I don’t want to talk to him about this situation and how it made me feel because that will just result in an argument I won’t win. I don’t really know what i’m asking for here.

83,Women I just met being really forward. Her girlfriends told me to stay away from her. Not sure how to handle.,"
Hi, I(23M) went out with my good friend Daren(23M)last Friday. We met up at a bar and his two friends Jayden (23F) and Hayley(22F) were at the table. I never met them before. Before I get there I guess Daren told Jayden that I am “off limits”. I started talking to both Jayden and Hayley about random stuff. Jayden told me she goes to therapy twice a week. I told her I go once a week. I told her I enjoyed therapy and she tells me “wow green flag”. 10 minutes into talking with them I see jayden is noticeably very drunk. Jayden and I start talking about the gym because we both go a lot. We start talking about workouts. Jayden asks for my Instagram. She then asks if I am single which I tell her yes. She starts biting her lip when she looks at me, whispering to her friends, asking me very  forward sexual  questions. She asked Daren if she can switch spots in order for her to sit next to me. 

She later asks for my tik tok and she shows me videos of her making tik toks about other men she talks to etc. 
Later on that night she started making out with me. I am a very shy guy and I didn’t know how to handle this. She kept telling me I’m muscular, touching my pecs, arms, shoulders. I kind of ignored it. Both of her women friends told me to not go after her and Daren agreed. Is there a reason they are telling me this? I kinda think Jayden looks for a lot of male attention but maybe I’m reading this wrong. I hope I don’t sound misogynistic.

84,"Unless you are in an established relationship with someone, there needs to be a degree of emotional detachment regarding a potential future with them","
It’s natural to want a future with someone you find attractive, or think you have a connection with.

However, projecting romantic feelings onto someone you barely know—or a “friend” that you’ve never been romantic with—often leads to neediness and insecure attachment.

The fantasy perception of the person overtakes who they actually are. They are often placed on pedestal unnecessarily. In an attempt to keep this idealized person in your life, the interactions become less natural, more focused on pleasing them, rather than being yourself and allowing things to develop naturally.

When you meet someone you like, it’s fine to appreciate them, but be wary of forming an emotional attachment to them. There has to be a phase that is a trial period. Not only do they need to learn about you, but you also need to determine if they fit what YOU want.

Have fun, let things unfold naturally. A relationship will develop without planning or thought if you both have chemistry. Trying to force things to fit a romantic fantasy never works.",tyda33,2142,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tyda33/unless_you_are_in_an_established_relationship/
85,A guy got mad because I wouldn’t have sex with him without a condom,"I (19F) went home this guy (23M) I’ve been seeing for months. He told me he just wanted to see me as he was away for a few weeks. Before going home with him I told him that I don’t want to have sex with him. He agreed and even said he didn’t want to have sex either. He drove 30 mins to pick me up and go back to his home. We watched a movie while cuddling and he started to get very touchy. He put his hands inside my shirt and pants. From that point I knew that we were gonna end up having sex so I asked him if he had a condom and he said no. I closed my legs and then quickly pull up my pants but he kept opening them apart and taking off my pants. I said that I am not down to have sex if it’s without any protection. He asked me why and I answered that I am afraid to get pregnant as I’ve already had a pregnancy scare before and it was the worst feeling ever. I also said that there’s a chance of either of us catching an STD if we don’t use a condom, as we both have a history of having multiple sexual partners (getting an STD test in our country will cause deportation if resulted positive) He then insisted that he will not get me pregnant nor does he have an STD. At this point he’s starting to get mad and even said that he’s “not comfortable with using a condom”, to which I replied, “I am not comfortable without a condom.” The argument lasted for a few minutes and I was already starting to get uncomfortable and thinking about wanting to go home. 

In the end he told me that if I don’t want to have sex then I should just give him a head at least. I agreed but told him that I would like to go home immediately after. That kind of disappointed him and he walked out of the room. While he was out I was already starting to look for a ride home but before I found one he walked back in fully dressed and told me that he’s sending me back home. On the ride home neither of us said a single word and I really wanted to cry since this has never happened to me before. Once we reached my home I just said bye and he didn’t even look at me. I’ve been thinking of blocking him but I’m expecting some kind of apology and at the same time I kinda feel bad for him.

I haven’t been in a relationship for a couple of years now and have been trying to get back into the game via the online dating apps. I’ve had some success with matches and getting a conversation going, the only problem lies in when they ask me what I do for work. 

I work inventory for a hospital, it’s not exactly the most lucrative of jobs but it does pay enough for me to live alone with my dog fairly comfortably. I also deliver pizza as a second job for the extra income. As soon as I tell my matches this they ghost, or worse just unmatch me entirely. I think I’ve talked to 20 or so women and consistently had these results. 

It’s really destroying my confidence because I haven’t had the opportunity to go to college for numerous reasons (hence the second job!) but I also don’t want to be with someone who only sees me as a paycheck.

89,The woman I'm dating (25F) says she's going to platonically sleep over at her ex BF's place. How do I (25M) respond?,"UPDATE: THE NEXT DAY

The initial text is still unanswered, along with my phone call earlier today (Friday), which means Eve is likely going to sleep tonight having seen my text and phone call and ignored me. Tomorrow is the fated Saturday, and I expect to find out that she went through with her plans. I'll update sometime Sunday or Monday if anything important happens.

Yes, I'm defensive and in denial, I know her, and you don't, and I won't apologize for denying the majority position. Believe what you want, it doesn't matter to me, because the main problem is one of presumption; any position that presumes guilt before she's even done anything, while using one statement as absolute truth and proof, and another statement being thrown out as lies, makes no sense. Do with that what you will, I'm going to talk to her, and I'll know when I look her in the eyes and ask her directly if she telling me the truth.

END OF UPDATE, BELOW IS ORIGINAL POST

Honestly it's pretty simple. I'm seeing a woman (we'll call her Eve), we hit it off, and have had several dates, a bar, a cafe, and she's been over to my apartment twice, but we haven't gone to ""3rd base"" and she hasn't slept at my place.

I work odd hours, I was asleep late in the evening, and she calls me. I wake up, answer my phone when I see Eve's name. She's driving home, curios and chatty, and asks me a bunch of times to just talk about something, but I can't think of anything, I'm drowsy and still half awake with blackout curtains in the dark. I finally think about asking to do something together this weekend.

This is where my mind absolutely derails from happy and drowsy to confused and alert.

She says she already has plans on Saturday, she spending time with her ex-boyfriend (who we will call Bob), who is still a friend in some capacity, but I don't think I have the full explanation. I probe with a couple more questions, and discover she's planning to spend the night at his place, which means she's busy Sunday too. I'm now shocked into silence on the phone, and unable to continue a decent conversation, but I'm saved by a female friend calling Eve so she hangs up with me to take the other call.

I texted her about 12 hours later, the next morning, and that was 24 hours ago with no response. The text is basically ""Help me understand because I can't seem to make sense of [this] and it's bothering me.""

This is a deeply uncomfortable situation for me. I've come to care for her, we are starting to get to know each other, and her coworkers also liked me when I met them. 

I want to understand, but this also seems like a red flag. 

Is this visit to Bob's truly platonic? Why stay the night? This doesn't feel right, and I've always trusted my instincts, so it's truly bothering me.


EDIT:
I've seen several comments along the same lines, that I'm being used or tested in a twisted game. I'm going to disregard these and some other comments; I cannot understand the heartless among you who are so flippant in your advise. By both action and description she has repeatedly affirmed that to use/abuse or otherwise play games with me would be completely contrary to her character. Let me be clear, if she is using me or playing games, our next conversation will bring that to light and it will be the end of the relationship. However it is not clear to me that either her plans or current silence are certain enough indicators to be actionable to the extremes people have advised. I suppose I've gotten what I was looking for, I have checked my emotions and now see what most people think of the outward appearances of these circumstances, and this allows me to offer to anyone who will read this, my current decision for my course of action.

I will try to talk to her before Saturday, and should I be able to hold a reasonable conversation that clarifies mine and Eve's thoughts and actions, the two of us will decide how to proceed. 

If she refuses to have a conversation before going to her ex on Saturday and proceeds with her plans, I will not tolerate it. It is a strict boundary in my heart, if she goes, my doors close, both emotionally and physically. In truth, I can already feel my heart anticipating this outcome, and readying itself, because I do care about her and it would not be nothing to me to bar her from my life. 

Lastly, thank you.

90,"Maybe I’m the only one who feels like this needs to be said, but stop taking dating advice from people who dated in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.","I see men who take dating advice from their grandfather and they wonder why having a job and car doesn’t get them a girlfriend. All your grandfather needed was a job at a factory and a pickup truck to get laid because women were oppressed and couldn’t even open a bank account. He knows nothing about dating in todays time don’t listen to him.

I’ve met women who say their fathers tell them to “never ask a man out” or “don’t pay for anything until you’re married”. Those women cling to that and wonder why they might struggle dating. Also you know that your father is a misogynist right? And if he dated in modern times the same way he did when he was he’d probably get hemmed up on SA charges we’ve all heard stories.

This was probably more of a persona vent or rant and I had to get out, but pretty much don’t take dating advice from people who haven’t dated in the smartphone era.

93,Tinder date was a disaster,"So, after being single for almost two years after a very painful break up and doing a lot of work on myself, I (M41) decided to download Tinder and see how I get on with tentatively putting myself out there again. 

I met a really nice woman (F36). She was attractive, easy to talk to, interesting, funny. She was not long out of a messy break up herself so she said she was looking to take it slow with the right guy. Alright, so far so good. 

There was a festival in town at the weekend. Live bands, food trucks, that kinda thing, so we arranged to meet at 6pm on the Saturday and go check it out. 

Oh boy. She turned up very drunk. Like almost unable to stand drunk. Way more drunk than she wanted to admit to me, because she was insisting she was fine. I said we should get her some food and maybe a coffee to help her sober up and she said that’s a good idea, so we headed into the festival. We got some Mexican food, and as I was ordering, she also ordered two bottles of tequila beer and paid for them. So much for coffee. 

She proceeded to get even more drunk (or perhaps just maintain the level of drunk she was at) but insisted she was absolutely fine and can handle her drink. We sat and talked for a while, listened to some bands, drank, danced, it was nice, and after a bumpy start, I thought the date was actually going okay. 

Around 11pm, the festival was winding down for the night, so I said we should call it a night. She said she wanted to stay out “unless we’re leaving so we can go to your place to fuck”. 

Whoa! Okay. While I appreciated the offer, in good faith, I absolutely couldn’t have had sex with her being as drunk as she was. I’d had, like, three beers and wasn’t even buzzed and she was struggling to stand up. I said that I didn’t think that was a good idea this time, but maybe down the line, of course she can come back to mine. 

I think I said the wrong thing, because in the middle of the festival, well, she kinda lost it. She started yelling at me “what the fuck is wrong with you? Why don’t you want to fuck me?” I tried to calm her down but she continued “am I not pretty enough, or do you just have a tiny dick?” at this point, people are staring and coming over to ask if everything is okay etc. 

I said “okay then, let’s go” and we headed towards a taxi rank. When we got there, I opened the door for her, and she got in. I went round and got in the passenger side, and said to the driver “listen, here’s £20. Make sure she gets home”. My date wasn’t listening, she was singing away in the back seat. I got out of the taxi, and stood and watched bewildered as it drove away. Ten minutes later, I got a text saying “I’m home! Goodnight”. 

The next day, she texted to say she had a great time, but is so embarrassed that she doesn’t feel like she can see me again. She then blocked my number and I’ve not heard from her since. 

Sex on the first date hadn’t crossed my mind, but either way, I’d feel so uncomfortable sleeping with someone as drunk as she was. It wouldn’t have been right. 

Did I do the right thing or was I a bit of an arsehole to her? Is this what dating is like now? 

I feel like I wanna keep trying to meet someone but dunno if it’s worth the hassle now",wksq6b,2033,514,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wksq6b/tinder_date_was_a_disaster/

95,Follow up on my Best Friends Wife's Tinder profile... Not the outcome i had in mind but definitely a positive one!,"Here's the original post... [https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/v1y8i0/i\_35m\_just\_found\_out\_on\_tinder\_that\_the\_wife\_34/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/v1y8i0/i_35m_just_found_out_on_tinder_that_the_wife_34/)

After many days of thinking about how to tell my friend about seeing his Wife's photos on Tinder, i decided to just straight out tell him everything. I figured its the best way!

I gave him a video call on Viber on Wednesday afternoon when i knew his Wife was still at work, as he finishes work earlier than her and i knew i had around 1-2 hours to talk.

I asked him how everything was he said everything is fine. I asked how his business is going he said great. I asked him how everything is with ""X"" his wife he said amazing! I was starting to feel bad so i didnt want to just sugarcoat questions and stress him out and just got to the point!

I told him i had seen a profile on Tinder with photos of his Wife, with a different name age and location and some photos which i hadnt sen on any of her other social media, but i wasnt sure if it was a fake account or her. He didnt look angry... I even asked him if they were in an open marriage, which is totally cool so many people do that and so many people are happy with that arrangement and this is where he got angry and his answer was ""Are you kidding dude? F\*ck NO! Why the f\*ck would i want that?!

I was expecting him to be really shocked about telling him what i saw, but for some reason he wasnt, it's like he had a suspision about it before... I hadnt heard from him since Wednesday and i gave him a call yesterday, he didnt answer (he always does his phone is on him 24/7 due to his work) So i waited for about 2 hours and texted him asking ""You ok dude?"" And he gave me a call back on friday afternoon while he was driving...

He told me on Friday he checked his wifes phone when she was doing the laundry, and went through it to find any apps, nothing. He then opened all apps that he was sure of and he found an app called FLO and it was pink and had a feather... He thought it was weird because she was on the pill a few months after their second Child was born that was 4 years old now...

He opened it, and what do you know... He found her Tinder profile... He saw she had a different name, location, age, and general bio... He saw about 200 matches and about 20-30 scroll downs filled with probably more than 100 messages from dozens of guys dating back to 2 years ago...

He opened a lot of the chats, they were extreme... Most of them flirting and sexting, and a lot of them saying things like ""I cant wait to meet up again, i still think about all those things you did to me and im just getting wet thinking about them..."" (i cant put the details here its a lot) A lot of those messages even had hook up times, almost all of them where from the times of 6-9pm.

He felt sick to his stomach, feeling the ground underneath his collapsing and just felt sick! He took photos with his own phone on a lot of messages and her profile....  
Well so apparently the loving Wife & Mother he has turned out to be a sex addict, and now everytime she was late at work he is thinking how many of those were true.

Now he was thinking how many guys she slept with which was more than 40 based on the messages confirming how much she liked what they did to her... He put her phone back in her bag, went to the downstairs bathroom, and felt so nauseated and puked and started to cry for a few minutes and then decided to go to his office to cool down and telling his Wife he had to go fix some client portfolios and be back in a few hours even though he knew she would probably be using Tinder the moment he left...

When he told me all this, i felt so bad because i was really hoping it was a fake profile... I told him i was so sorry and i was sorry for telling him all this and he said ""No man youre like a brother even it it was a fake profile i wouldnt get mad at you... Im just lost right now and have a lot to think about... I had some thoughts that she was being weird somertimes but my mind would never even go there..."" I told him again im really sorry and that if he needs anything to just call me!

He called me today told me he spoke to his Cousin, who is a divorce lawyer and also a district Attorney, and his cousin advised him to get as many facts and evidence as he can... Not only through her phone, but her icloud and emails etc...He felt even more sick but is going to work out how to do that as well...

His Cousin told him, with enough evidence and a witness or two from hotel clerks who are willing to testify seeing her at times she was ""working late"" with someone else even though she never paid for anything with a back trail or the guys paying, but through finding dates and times of messages confirming the hookup and by showing her photos to the clerks to find the video feed of the hotels security cameras if they had some too...

He is going to spend the next few weeks gathering all the information he can, and he is going to proceed filing a divorce once he has everything he needs...

He even asked if i was willing to testify, and i said ""WITHOUT A DOUBT!"" And then i told him lets call all the old gang from 20 years ago and hang out next Saturday ordering pizzas and beer or even going out all together! He said he was in and he's gonna call up everyone to arrange it...

So im looking forward to that and thats something nice to get his mind off things!

TL;DR This was a long and scattered post but people had asked me to follow up on what happened... I feel bad for him, but you know what? F\*CK HER! She didnt respect him or her family! I feel ZERO remorse for whats going to happen to her and she shouldnt have cheated! People like this deserve to get screwed over! When the person youre with has supported you more than anyone you've ever met, paying off your loans and being there when your Dad was sick and dying, hiring doctors and paying for everything, and this is your thank you? Yeah... She can GFH!

P.S To all those people who kept saying ""Mind your own business!"" you can also GFY for since so many of you are cheaters and you hate if someone ruined your precious affair!",v5k78z,2004,382,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v5k78z/follow_up_on_my_best_friends_wifes_tinder_profile/
96,"I broke up with someone who loves me, and it's harder than I thought","I (25F) have been seeing an incredibly sweet guy (28M) for 4 months, he is amazing on paper. But throughout the whole relationship, I was overwhelmed with anxiety feeling that it was not right. Like, I was not letting myself fall for him, and kept pushing it away. I felt like he was in a honeymoon phase without me. He treated me like noone else, 

I finally got up the courage to break it off - and I feel terrible. We had an incredibly long heart-to-heart break-up. I thought it would lift a weight off my chest, but I feel like crap. Maybe because I really care about him, maybe because I know that I shattered his heart. He told me he was in love with me, and I think I am the first person he has been in love with. I am now so confused with emotions, did I have he same feelings for him without realizing? Or are breakups just hard on everyone involved?

98,Date got pissed because I snuck snacks into movie theater lol....,"On a third date with this girl I matched with originally on fb dating, we decided to do a movie date and go to the theaters. I was the one that originally bought the tickets ahead of time. As tradition whenever I'm dating other partners, we always end up sneaking snacks or food into the theater cause we're not going to overpay for that ridiculous priced food or candy LOL. In a joking manner leading up to the date, I gave my new date a heads up thru text that she better bring the biggest purse she has so we could sneak snacks in. Thru text she basically laughed at the comment and we went back and forth thru friendly banter. But she basically said she won't be my accomplice. So yesterday was the date, before going to the theater, I stopped by Walgreens (like I always do for snacks for the movies) and got candy/drinks for both of us. I had an idea of what she liked candy wise and drink wise so I got her a coke and snickers lol. When I arrive to the movies, she's waiting outside the theater and she was shocked seeing me carry a bag with snacks in it LOL. She seemed immediately turned off by the idea of it. Idk if she thought I was joking the whole time. Basically she had a small purse and she was like I'm not helping you sneak that stuff in. She ended up putting one of my candy boxes in her purse while I put both our drink cans in my pockets and other candy in my back pocket LMAO. But I could tell my her body language she was pissed alittle. Anyway she didn't think I'd be able to pull it off and get caught, but guess what, I was able to get my muscle milk and runts into the theater along with her coke and snickers 🤣🤣🤣🤣 just a funny story I wanted to share.

*Update* I texted my date from yesterday asking her if I made her feel uncomfortable because of putting her on the spot with the snack situation. Do note it seemed like we still had a good time at the movies yesterday and she did text me when we both got home she had a good time. She actually reached out first today asking me how my Sunday was. Here's her response about the snack situation:

He replied “No blue cheese. Also you should consider a cholesterol test if you are eating that much steak and eggs.” Was he being negative? Somehow I feel this is some kind of PUA trick to make me feel bad about myself. Is it a red flag or am I overthinking this?

Edit: I replied “It’s not much! It’s only one egg.” He replied “Everyday though. Adds up.” I then asked “Do you always offer health/diet advice” and he replied “just for a diet like that.” I then asked “what’s your cholesterol ratio” and he answered “Idk just know it’s good.” Sooo I ditched him.",sf768x,1999,580,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sf768x/guy_told_me_i_should_check_my_cholesterol_after_i/

She gave a list of things she won’t tolerate and one of them is a man who lived with his parents. 

But she explained that she herself lives with her mom…I called her out on it and she said “well it’s different because I’m a woman. IA woman can live with her parents to save money and it’s a smart move financially & things are hard out here.I’m independent and can do what’s best for me based on my financial status…but if a man doesn’t have his own place then it shows he’s far behind in life & needs to get his act together”

I wasn’t upset at her assumptions but just confused on the double standard   

I don’t think anyone living with their folks (by choice) is a bad thing. My friend is a millionaire and lived with her parents…I dated a woman who’s family culture was that you live with your parents til you’re married

Problem is, and I’m a shit person for it, but I got the ick tonight. We were having sex (not the first time) and I guess he’s now tapping into his more dominant side? Because I think he tried to be intense but overdid it, as when I looked up at him he was STARING down at me. Like boring into my soul with the most psychopathic face I’ve ever seen, and I can’t ever look at him the same.
I guess my questions are, am I a douche for wanting to end it, and would it be acceptable to just tell him that I’m not ready to date yet? It’s not been long since me and my partner separated, and he knows that.

106,You do not need to be perfect or to love yourself entirely before you seek a romantic partner,"The idea of ""you need to love yourself before you can love anyone else"" or ""to happy with someone else you must be happy alone"" has a lot of merit to it, yes, our relationships and our choice in partner would be much better off if we did indeed love ourselves entirely and were completely happy with ourselves. We would be able to feel secure in our relationships, we not tolerate maltreatment from others, we would stand up for ourselves, we be more present with our partner and be able to enjoy the amazing things that a loving relationship can bring.

However, there is a downside to this way of thinking, and it is the thought that we need to be perfect to be able to love and to be loved, it sets just another unobtainable ideal for us to reach for, leaving us feeling like we are never ready to open ourselves up to someone. We all know nobody is perfect, we all have aspects of ourselves that we wish were better, that is a fact of life and is what makes us human. This is unavoidable. To deny yourself the opportunity for love because you feel this way may actually just perpetuate your suffering, and the negative spiral of lack of self love, to isolation, to less self love, to more isolation, can send you into a tailspin.

Instead the approach we should adopt is self-compassion, acknowledge you are a human with flaws, we all are, and acknowledge that that does not disqualify you from love. You can love and be loved, whilst being imperfect.

Self-improvement is a journey of a lifetime, so if you adopt the idea that you need to be entirely happy with yourself before you open up to a romantic relationship, you may be waiting forever for that opportunity. Our partners to be can join us on our path to self-love, you can both grow together, learn from each other and support one another.

It should be noted that whilst you do not have be entirely in love with yourself to love and to be loved, you do need to have the mindset that you are willing to work on your shortfalls and to improve, and to help yourself do that. If do not adopt that mindset, you can't be expected to work on maintaining a relationship at the same time, because you'll inevitably run into a conflict and you'll be unable to compromise or reflect on what you've done wrong and correct yourself, any self-respecting person will not put up with that for long.",te62gp,1912,116,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/te62gp/you_do_not_need_to_be_perfect_or_to_love_yourself/
107,How to politely turn down girls?,"Last night I went out with some friends. We’re standing there with our drinks and these two girls walk up to me. One of them says “hey this is my friend (her name) it’s her birthday! Byeeee” then walked off. The girls were cute I guess but not my type. My friends turn their backs to me so it’s just me 1 on 1 with birthday girl. We talk for probably 10 mins. I kept seeing attractive girls walk by but I couldn’t break away from this girl to talk to them. I felt trapped. I kept trying to talk to my friends but she wouldn’t stop talking to me. Eventually she asked me if I thought she was pretty, so I said honestly “I think you look smart” she didn’t like that and left shortly after.

A similar thing happened last night when i was buying a drink. I’m waiting for my drinks to be made and these two girls are standing next to me, one of them says “how was your day?” This lead to another long conversation and I just wanted to bail. 

What’s the best way to get out of these situations sooner without being rude?

I don’t want to hurt these girls feelings by being too blunt but I also don’t want to waste my time when there’s other people I’d rather be talking to. I’m naturally really friendly and social so it’s easy to carry on a conversation forever, even with girls I’m not interested in.

When the stuff arrived he asked how much it was and I showed him the receipt. He said something along the lines of “damn, that’s a lot”. I was under the impression that we would split it. I’ve taken the pill twice before and both times the guys offered to pay half. Well, he didn’t. 

I’m kinda poor so I asked him if we can split and he said “I could pay you by doing something nice for you” and offered to make me breakfast. I got the ick and it was probably obvious from my face cause he apologized but still didn’t offer anything. I didn’t want to be entitled so I decided to skip breakfast and left. 

I’m my opinion, we would both be affected by an unwanted pregnancy so the fair thing to do would be to buy the pill together. Am I in the wrong here? I feel less attracted to him now. I know it’s my uterus but it wasn’t my fault, it was just something that happened to us.

I’m actually considering dumping him. Is that a legit reason though? Have anything like this happened to you before? And men here, do you usually offer to pay?

EDIT: Thanks for all the comments guys!
I want to add that:
1. I’m the one who pays for the condoms
2. I’m not on the pill because of health reasons but I’m looking for other types of birth control
3. He’s not broke. He makes good money, much higher than the average salary here and he owns a pretty big apartment, so not rent to worry about. It’s not like I asked for money he didn’t have.",t5rbv3,1878,414,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/t5rbv3/should_he_have_helped_me_pay_for_plan_b/
111,Dating a guy who isn’t abusive,"Today I posted a photo on my private Instagram story and it had the slightest hint of the guy I’m dating in it - but I covered him with an emoji. 

He then made a joke that I was “protecting his identity”. 

And I instantly took it down because I thought he was angry at me. 

My ex was so adamant about never publicly showing each other on social media and would call me crazy if I even commented on his posts. I just have it in my head that guys never ever want to be seen with me or connected with me. That it’s embarrassing for them. Or that I’m embarrassing myself. 
And if I do it, I’m going to be punished. 

But today this new guy I’m dating said “why would I be angry at you? You just did something cute”

If I want to date the only option I’d have left is to try talking to women in person. But since women don’t want men to speak to them, I have to avoid and not talk to women I don’t know. But then if I don’t know women, I can’t date. So now I’m back to square one. It’s like a catch 22.

114,We broke up because I am not into group sex,"
So, I (23M) had a girlfriend (22F) of 6 month and during one of our dates she told me
that she would like to visit a kinky-party. Her kink was group sex and | asked her if she
was only going to watch to which she replied that ""Kinky-party is not always watching,
most of the time not watching at all"". Right there and then I had an extreme anxiety attack, since, well, | read a lot of stories where men let their spouses to have group sex and most of the time that lead to extreme emotional damage since men
were not ready. I was not ready and I am rather monogamous, meaning that I go only for
exclusive relationships.

The next day I told her that we needed to talk and we had an argument about group sex
which ended with a break up since, well, I can't restrict anybody from doing anything and living in fear that my S/O can have threesome behind my back isn't very appealing. She would not give into my logical explanation that it hurts me and it hurts my principals.

This was 2 month ago, but I am now having extreme anxiety every time I think of a new
girlfriend, because I am afraid that they might be into group sex too. How can I get
over it? I am very confused about how to build relationships in the future and afraid I might catch feelings to such a girl which would leave me very hurt again. I feel betrayed and disgusted and can't stop thinking about the possibility of getting fucked up again. How can I help myself?

EDIT:

I am super grateful for all of the replies. Trust me, I read them all (from quite offensive jokes to really helpful advice and healing reassurance) and while I can't answer to all of you personally, I can thank you here. The volume of support I got is just phenomenal. Good luck to you all. 

I sincerely hope that this post's comments can be of help to anybody, who might find themselves in a similar situation. To anyone who does, this is what I learned from it: it's very easy to try and deceive yourself into certain beliefs, but the gut won't lie. Following the inner compass is overwhelmingly hard sometimes, but you only win from it. There is no ""Nash equilibrium"" in this game of incompatibility: it's you and your beliefs or them. I hope you find the strength to tell them what you really think, stranger. God bless you. 

P.S. I am not trying to imply that having kinks is bad. Your freedom ends right where the freedom of others starts. I only want to encourage you to stay authentic and deal with consequences whatever those might be.",ucde1x,1851,308,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ucde1x/we_broke_up_because_i_am_not_into_group_sex/
115,Girl accidentally sends me screenshot of my own text,"I went out on a date with a friend of a friend recently and the whole thing went great. We spent around 8 hours together and we talked literally the entire time. She told me she had a great time before we said goodbye. I texted her after to say how much I enjoyed spending the day with her, and she responded immediately saying the same and that she'd love to go out with me again.

So everything was going great, until the next day when she sent me a photo. I opened the text and it was a screenshot of the text I sent her after the date. She deleted it soon afterwards, and I'm not sure if she knows that I saw it.

I wasn't sure what to make of this, I felt like she might be making fun of me by sending my slightly embarrassingly vulnerable text to her friends. She texted me afterwards though as if nothing had happened.

116,She isn’t worth it,"Been trying to get this girl I really like to go on a date for me for about two months, we go clubbing together most weekends and have kissed. This time I organized a whole ass plan. She and her friend came to my house, I invited a friend over that I knew her friend liked so she had more incentive to come. 

I picked them up, we went to my house, I cooked for her because she was hungry, we had a cool ass evening and ended up going up to the roof of my house at night and talked for hours. At the end of the Convo when we were about to climb down I kissed her and she responded positively. 

We decided to go clubbing since well, it’s the weekend isn’t it.

About an hour later she went to the bathroom, half an hour went by and she hadn’t come back so I decided to go check if she was ok. I found her tongue deep in another dude, she stayed there for over an hour.
When it was about 6 AM and we all wanted to leave we had to wait for her because she wasn’t answering  her phone.

I thought about leaving her, I should have if I’m honest. But she’s best friends with one of my closest friends and to be frank, I’m not that guy. I can’t leave her alone in the middle of the night, I wasn’t raised like that.

117,Would you continue to date someone that didn't do the one specific thing that you love in bed?,"Okay, so I'm middle aged, been around the block and the dating pool is more like a cesspool. 

But I recently met someone that I clicked with. 

Things pretty soon turned physical and the sex itself is amazing but for one problem.  He doesn't like to give oral sex.  He hasn't specifically asked for oral but I enjoy giving and receiving and there was no problem with him receiving. 

I hinted and hinted and then eventually, he came to me about 2 weeks into getting to know each other and told me that he gets bored easily and would like to try watching porn together.   I told him it shouldn't be a problem but the porn I watch is mostly women getting eaten out and he's very stingy with that.  It's then that he told me he doesn't like giving it and I told him then I no longer want to keep seeing him and that it is an immediate deal-breaker for me.

I spent 5 years in a relationship where the guy wouldn't reciprocate and I never want to feel that resentment and/or rejection again.

My issue is, if he's so easily bored and already want to introduce new and kinky things but won't even go down, is that a major red flag or no?",xc8hg9,1831,436,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xc8hg9/would_you_continue_to_date_someone_that_didnt_do/
118,“Chemistry”means attraction on the first date,"You may be confused hearing “we had no spark” , what this translates to is “I’m not attracted to you, sexually and romantically”. Sure the way you present yourself helps and I’m not dismissing personality at all, but you don’t really know someone after date 1, so if there is rejection its mostly because they aren’t into you, 80% if not more because of how you look and the rest is other flaws they can’t avoid because of this

Take it from me, a guy who had 4 no spark texts in a row and now is exclusive, I acted no different on the dates and the girl I’m exclusive with I acted a bit awkward, I didn’t even initiate a kiss she did.

The answer is don’t, you have the right to say no as well. They don’t owe you romantic and you don’t owe them platonic. It doesn’t make you immature or insecure it just means you have boundaries too. Block them on everything if you have to to feel healthy. The next person deserves the best of you. You won’t be able to give that if you’re distracted by your feelings for them.

And when he texts or calls that will be cool!

I recently decided I would meet people in person anywhere I go and that I would talk to others and compliment them and meet someone organically instead of offline and it was neat to be met with that same level of interest/effort. FREAKING COOL.

I genuinely feel terrible . He knows about my ED and how I’m trying extremely hard to gain muscle and lose weight in a healthy manner but he constantly reminds me of how physically unattractive I am. He also thinks I’m not smart and don’t have ambition. He said he thinks we won’t last. But he says he loves me and appreciates all the things I do for him and appreciates how we can be so comfy w eachother 

I don’t know what to do. I love him but I feel inadequate. I feel like every time he looks at me he is thinking about how ugly I am. I want to be better in all of the categories he wants me to but it’s hard. I feel stuck bc I lost my virginity to him and I know I will never be as close to someone in my life. I really don’t want to break up w him but I don’t want him to be unsatisfied.

He was such a good kisser, he said that I was too, and we kissed for 5 hours. 2 in a row, then other 2 and 1...

I went back home, stood in the shower while giggling to myself like a teenager. After 10 years of unsuccessful dating, you think you've seen it all, and then you find yourself in fantasy land.

When meeting him I didn’t eve recognize him because in reality he was actually very tall, probably between 6’2 and 6’4. im used to guys making themselves taller, not shorter so I asked why he listed himself as shorter. He said that he’s tired of girls only being into how tall he is so he put that he was shorter to weed out those kinda girls. He then said he was happy that I went out with him despite me thinking I was taller and that I “passed his test”.

I became curious, she said she started working in a brothel on the weekends when she finished up with school and turned 18. Said she slept with on average about 4 people per day (working 2 days per week) . Did this for a couple of years, had a 2 year break and went back to private work for another couple years.
I ran some numbers in my head and calculated for to have slept with around 2000+ people. She said she didn't like it, but I asked her why she went back after the break and she couldn't answer. 

What even gets me more is that she didn't do it for the money, she did it out of curiosity as she did an assignment on it in school. She told me she loved the sense of empowerment she got out of it, which is why she stuck with it. She said when she would walk out of the brothel she would stare at people in the eyes on the streets with no one knowing what she had just done. This weirded me out.

She said she was young and stupid, but she said she only stopped in 2020, so less than 2 years ago.

135,She wanted to wait before having sex so we can connect mentally…now she’s ready but I’m not sure if I am,"
We’re are both in our 20s 

We’ve been dating for a few months and honestly in all my past relationships sex had always happened immediately and easily. 

But with her it’s different, she asked for time to connect, be emotionally intimate and feel comfortable with each other before we actually have sex. Honestly I said sure but we are dating anyways and I figured I’m sure it’ll be worth the wait and sometimes sex can complicate things so why not? (But honestly sex was big on my mind) I figured sure I’ll wait for a bit and see what she’s about. She explained she’s a Demi-sexual (which I honestly had to read to understand). So we waited for 2-3 months and although I admittedly wanted to make moves I respected that boundary and just connected. Although it was very annoying to work with at first  

She took me by surprise bc we started doing things I never enjoyed or even experienced with (without sex clouding things): we have would stay up late and talk… and I mean REALLY talk about who we wanted to be & what we shared our views on deep past traumas. We had days where we would have nap dates (naps in her room with movies), When something good happened we were the first person we wanted to share with each other, we shared our goals and came up with plans on how to help the other person reach them, she held me when I cried, I held her when she was scared, we took a bath together (with no sex) and she washed my back and kissed my shoulders and we listened to our favorite songs and fell asleep in the warm water, I even let her pop my pimples when she asked. She even met my parents and they love her. She showed me things I needed to unlearn and grow from and with and I’m focused on being a better man …she’s the only woman I realized I didn’t have to try with and I could just relax and just be. No games, no presentation, no trying to earn affection…just BE 

Last night was my birthday and I spent the day with her, we cuddled and played video games, we made out, we even had a small conflict and talked our way through it. We stayed up late drinking coffee and relaxing…she lived an hour away and asked me to spend the night . She let me know she’s ready to have sex…after 2 months …but I told her not tonight…she was confused and honestly so was I. I realized sex in the past complicate things and I had such a goood day with her, I wanted to stay connected and just enjoy it all without anything clouding it for today

I’m a guy, I have a high sex drive and I’m highly attracted to her …but sex isn’t a priority anymore with her and now i am hesitant bc I don’t want it to ruin or cause an imbalance on what we are enjoying and building. We aren’t even official yet but we aren’t talk to anyone else or seeing anything else..

It’s a bitter pill to swallow I know but the sooner you do it the better. For the vast majority of people. No amount of personality will make you attractive if you’re fat and ugly. The reason she don’t like you is because she doesn’t find you attractive. It’s that simple. I’ve seen way too many upvotes on posts with terrible advice. It’s like a point system. Nobody is going to dock you if you have a great body and a good job but they will if you don’t and for the vast majority of people having a good body and job is the minimum requirement. Furthermore when you’re physically attractive it ups your confidence a lot, thereby making your personality attractive as well. 

This is probably going to get downvoted but I hope this at least reaches people new to dating who are wondering why they suck. Go to the gym, take care of your skin, get a decent job and talk to women. Easier said than done I know, but nothing of value is ever given freely.",rkqp01,1741,581,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rkqp01/im_so_tired_of_the_dumb_dating_advice_thats/
137,I wish she did not confess at all,"
(Last July) My girlfriend confessed her feelings to her long-time close friend that he was her first love even though they were just friends. She confessed her feelings to that friend so my girlfriend can finally move on, so she can love me alone with all her heart.

I was flattered, congratulations to me, it's supposed to be sweet right? No.

December happened. Her close friend confessed to my girlfriend as well. He wanted to court her. He said that what if in the end, they were meant for each other instead?

Yes, my girlfriend broke up with me. I gave her the option to consider giving that friend of hers a chance. Just a chance. My girlfriend of almost 6 years, I never thought that she will accept that option...

What I did was right, I guess? I think it's an evitable event that even if i did not give her that option today, someday it'd be a cycle that's always bound to happen. What's happening right now is at least better than a possibility of cheating while we're married right? I just don't know what to do while she's answering her ""what ifs"" in her life.

There's a chance that the friend and my ex would work out. There's also a chance that they wouldn't. I know my worth, but I still love my ex so much. What could I do, if she is my first love.

I appreciate that she was transparent and honest to me to say everything, instead of cheating.",s4heff,1736,409,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/s4heff/i_wish_she_did_not_confess_at_all/
138,Girl I went on a date with got offended by my instagram bio,"So when I signed up for instagram awhile ago there was a section for pronouns. I’m a bit of a joker with things like that.

I put in my IG bio my

Pronouns: Arch Bishop / God Emperor 

Ended up going on a date with some girl. She added me on IG later and basically shit a brick about my pronouns joke. 

She started going on some tirade about how I’m a bigot. I have nothing against trans people but I think a lot of the neopronouns are goofy like xe xir xhey whatever. 

So I explained that to her and it’s a joke more about me pretending to be better than I am by telling people to refer to me as “God emperor” and basically she blocked me.

139,Casual sex is so hard,"I’ve been having sex with this guy for about 5 months now, and I left him on read a few weeks ago because it was really damaging my well-being as I started to get attached and didn’t like the lack of reciprocation as it was majorly just face snaps on Snapchat. Anyways, he texted me a few days ago, and I ended up seeing him on the weekend. Of course, this texting was him acting all interested in how I’ve been, what I’ve been up to etc. when I was well aware of what he actually wanted, and so I gave in as I was feeling like it as well.

Let me tell you, those few weeks of not snapchatting him were euphoric, I wasn’t worried about IF or WHEN he was going to respond and I had such a great time not worrying. And now I’m stuck in that same cycle after he came back in contact with me again.


I hate this feeling, should I just leave him on read until I want to see him again and have a conversation about how we can go about this? Its more of a me problem and I overthink our communication on social media way too much but the only way for me to fix it is to stop engaging on Snapchat with him daily, but I’m worried he will get angry/confused and won’t want to see me again!!

EDIT: Here’s why I think it’s a bit harder for me to let go and might provide a bit more context: he was my first sexual experience, and I actually did approach him and had a conversation about “what we are” and he said he considers me a friend and I told him that that’s okay but I just get confused with that sort of mentality.",wptgwo,1717,300,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wptgwo/casual_sex_is_so_hard/

141,"I’m suppose to go on a date tonight, when he tells me today he’s herpes positive.","I like him, we havnt met yet though. I don’t *want* it to be a dealbreaker, but I’m running through how sex would go in my head, and I’m at a loss for how to protect myself without being extremely worried the whole time. 

My dating life kind of sucks right now too, so I don’t want to put myself at risk for someone that may be settling for anyways. I’m not going to worry about this if it turns out we don’t click, and he seems to plan to take me on a few dates to get to know each other first anyways. 

The fact he was honest is a big reason I don’t want to completely write him off yet. Does anyone here have any advice or tips for protecting myself? Anything to remind me it’s not as bad as it sounds, the virus is extremely stigmatized.

Edit: it’s type 2 for people asking

Update???: idk if anyone cares but because 1 commenter asked I’ll provide! Basically, 2 days before the date I went out to an area in my city that’s live with bars for Julys first Friday. (Yes I’ve decided to update 2 weeks after said update but I don’t care). Well I told him what I was up to that night and he fucking shows up??? Claimed he went with friends but was alone because they wanted to go to places to drink in a different bar crawl area. Anyways I felt compelled to babysit him, and he hung out with us all night but it was my first time out with my bff since she broke her foot and I spent NO time with her. I couldn’t even dance or socialize like I usually enjoy because he was very handsy but to the point of where I was so locked in by him a few women asked if I was okay. 

Well because I’m still an idiot and wanted to brush that off I took him home, no sex already decided. Well, he spent the whole night humping me without my consent when I told him I felt unwell & wanted to sleep. Yeah. He’d continue to hump me after about a minute of obeying my request. It got to the point where I was very worried he was going to just take me. He kept trying to peel my clothes off despite my constant protests. 

I told him in the morning he had to go after snapping really hard in the middle of the night. While he waited for his Uber he was super apologetic and told me he’d leave me alone. I told him yeah I’d appreciate that because I was worried you were going to rape me, let alone the 15+ times you assaulted me *each time after I told him to fucking stop*. 

Yes I should’ve told him to leave in the middle of the night but I was honestly really scared because he made it clear he didn’t care about my discomfort.

Also he’s reached out 4 times since trying to make plans.. so much for respecting my boundaries! Why did he even offer up the idea that he wouldn’t reach out if he knew he would.

142,my fwb is in a serious relationship and never told me,"so me and this guy have been fwbs for 2 years now and was doing great. until couple of days ago he posted a mirror selfie of him with a RING on his ring finger and polaroids of a girl inside his phone's cover. then when i checked his account found out more pics of him and this girl, and they definitely seemed like a couple. everyone was commenting things like ""aww y'all look cute together"" and stuff like that. so i just texted him saying ""let's end things up"" and he was like ""weird but ok considering nothing happened"". so i texted back saying how i just figured he's in a relationship and never told me, since the whole fwbs thing is for single people (if I'm not getting this wrong tho) and this is pretty much cheating, unless they're in an open relationship (which i bet tbh). he then said ""I'll give you a little advice on how you should never say what you just said to anyone since it's non of your business ok budd? take care of yourself"" and I'm here all confused on how it's non of my business. first of all, i don't wanna be someone's side chick and DEFINITELY don't wanna fool someone by letting their partner cheat on them with me. I'm not that kind of a person. cuz i would definitely tell my fwb if I'm seeing someone, especially when it's a serious thing. so idk if I'm wrong for believing i have the right to know about the relationship or he's an absolute jerk.",vg9vch,1714,635,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vg9vch/my_fwb_is_in_a_serious_relationship_and_never/
143,Is there a double standard when it comes to sex?,"There’s no way to ask this without declaring world war 3 but I want to gain some other peoples insight. 

The double standard I’ve noticed, and had some friends notice as well is this;

If a man wants to get sexual and the woman isn’t in the mood, it’s not happening, back off, don’t pester her, just go and make her a hot chocolate and let her relax or do whatever she feels like doing. Any further attempts make you a disrespectful asshole. This is especially true in a relationship but even if it’s a friend with benefits.

Fair enough, nobody should be pressured into having sex if they’re not in the mood. 

However in my experience denying sex to a woman when she’s in the mood will more than likely leave her irate for a while and then sulking and wondering why you aren’t into her, what she did wrong, refusing to talk to you, or if you’re not that well established they will quite often block you or never attempt to speak to you again.

If they’re wanting to go all the way on a date but you’re not feeling like it, for whatever reason, then you can wager that you won’t be having another date. 

Is this due to the misbelief that all men are sex crazed Neanderthals so if they refuse sex even for a valid reason then it must indicate that they’re repulsed by you or something? 

Have you noticed anything similar or has this just been some unlucky experiences?",v9olyw,1709,298,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v9olyw/is_there_a_double_standard_when_it_comes_to_sex/
144,Is it appropriate for my girlfriend to keep this male friend around?,"Me [M28] and my GF [F25] have been dating for four months my gf has a male friend, we’ll call him John, that is a therapist that she has known for two years. She feels comfortable with this guy to talk about her problems with and she often goes out to bars with him alone to play pool and on one occasion got so drunk that she didn’t come home till the next morning after a night out with him. (We had a huge fight about this) Here’s where my distrust for the guy comes in, in the past, prior to her and I dating, John has made sexual advances at my girlfriend stating that they could still have sex and be friends. To which my girlfriend rejected him. Also on more than one occasion he has made comments to my face about “how great my gfs ass is”. So the attraction is obviously there in my opinion. My gf swears up and down that their relationship is plutonic but given Johns history with my gf I personally believe that their relationship is inappropriate and I’ve communicated this multiple times to my gf with not much success.

146,A girl I had been dating for a month was raped,"So context, I'm 21m in my third year at university. Me and this 18f girl matched with each other on tinder. We hit it off, she looked stunning. I asked her out to a date, we went for drinks and then to the fair. At no point during the date did it ever feel awkward or uncomfortable. We had chemistry and a tonne of things in common. 

After the date she ended up staying round at my place and fucked. I've been with other girls before, but with her it was intimate, we could laugh during sex and I loved talking with her after and waking up next to her I've never had anything like that with a girl before and she's absolutely stunning. 

She told me that she didn't know if she was ready to be in a relationship and that she had been raped before but that she liked me and had fun on the date.   We went on a few more dates and I loved every minute of it. I really grew to like her I thought she was perfect and I know she liked me too. Every time we met she stayed round at mine. I didn't want to be with anyone else. Admittedly we took things very fast but we were having fun.

Around a month into dating she went home for a couple of days and ever since then things were different she was more distant over messaging. We arranged a date and the day before she sent me a message and told me that she had been raped again when she went back home and that she isn't ready to be with anyone and that she needs therapy. We left things on very good terms and I tried to be as supportive as I could be. I told her I completely understand and that I'm going to miss her. She said she liked me, she had fun and she enjoyed getting to know me but shes not ready for anything right now.

We weren't dating long but I really grew to like her, I didn't want to be with anyone else. I keep thinking about her, shes one of the sweetest and most innocent girls I've ever met and it pains me thinking that someone could do that to her.

I don't know what to do, I want to give her space but I don't want to cut her out of my life. I want to see her again but I'm afraid that's never going to happen.",ykogd6,1697,253,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ykogd6/a_girl_i_had_been_dating_for_a_month_was_raped/

148,Went on a first date today. Would it be bad if I texted him and told him I’m feeling sexually needy and can’t stop thinking of him?,"I had a first date today with a man 9 years older than me; the largest age gap I’ve yet to experience by 7 years. He was so confident and comfortably affectionate and sooo sexy. Like so fucking sexy. The date went well, we kissed a handful of times and both texted each other later after to say we had a great time. 

To be blunt, I’m super horny and can’t stop thinking about him. I want to text him and tell him I’m thinking of him because I’m hoping he’d find it sexy, but I’m not sure if it would be received that way? To clarify, we talked about relationships and how we’re both on dating apps right now (how we met) to have fun and see where things go. I’d like to explore a casual sexual relationship with him, nothing more at the moment. 

That being said, I’m more so looking for advice on what to do with the knowledge that I just want a casual friends with benefits thing. I don’t want a serious relationship right now, so I don’t feel that advice geared towards how this may affect a long term relationship would be applicable. 

I just want to say something sexy but I don’t want to be a creep! I’ve never had a casual relationship before. Any advice?? 

[Ages are F21 and M30]

UPDATE: I texted him and he quickly responded that he loved that I was thinking of him and we sexted for an hour and I’m going to his place next week!! Guys even his sexting is hot. He used all the right words and tone and made me feel a way I haven’t felt while texting someone in a very long time. Thank you all for the advice and massive confidence boost, I am so excited!! :)

CLARIFICATION: I’ve had a few repeat topics come up in the comments so I wanted to clarify some things real quick.
1) I was/am sexually attracted to him before I saw his confidence. He’s very attractive and just my type so his personality is just an added bonus. 
2) I am only looking for something casual right now! I don’t care if my bluntness makes him not want to call me his girlfriend, I don’t want to be his girlfriend. I have a habit of falling into serious relationships right after I get out of one and I’m trying to break that cycle. 
3) I understand the concern regarding the age gap. I have been groomed in the past and also emotionally abused by a parent and past partners. I am fully aware of all of the warning signs and take many precautions to set boundaries and speak up about how I feel and what I want. 9 years is not a crazy age gap for adults, and this is me experimenting with my sexuality. (Which I’m personally very excited to do!)
4) Some people are shaming me for being “down bad” or too forward or impatient. I just got dumped and am trying to get back out there and frankly won’t feel bad for being super excited that a hot, intelligent, sexy, mature man wants to have a sexual relationship with me. Ya girl deserves it haha! :)",w53wd0,1684,273,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/w53wd0/went_on_a_first_date_today_would_it_be_bad_if_i/

Edit: we did not have sex. BUT I mean it got pretty close. We were both in agreement that the second date was too soon. Despite us both very much wanting to.

151,Noticed a Trend,"Guy in my early 20’s here.I date around a good amount in my free time. I’ve noticed the girls who are the loudest about how confident, independent and pretty they are tend to be the most insecure ones with the most emotionally damaged and toxic issues. On top of that they talk about how high their standards are, and it’s just odd the social awareness they lack to gas themselves up so much. It’s kind of the female equivalent of the guy who needs to tell everyone he’s an alpha. At this point if there’s a girl who tends to overly convey how highly she thinks of herself and how loud and independent she is, the bigger warning sign it is to me. Often the most calm and well put together girls tend to be the ones who are lowkey and don’t need to go around saying they are confident in my experience. Does anyone else notice this?

152,Woman I'm dating doesn't seem to know much and I'm having a hard time connecting her,"I (29M) met a woman (she is 32) off of a dating app several months ago. She is kind, down to earth, polite, humble and all these traits made me feel attracted to her. From the very beginning, she seemed very innocent and clueless, closed. The more time I spend with her, the more realize I am unable to connect with her on any topic. However, I am trying to spend a bit more time trying to understand her because she’s a nice person, but I am starting to feel like I should give up and move on.

We are both from different countries and during the initial dates, we had plenty to talk about, but it was mostly me asking her questions about her culture and sharing stories from mine. She mainly likes to talk about her work and when I say work, it’s just “My co-worker went to holiday; my co-worker said that they did this; my co-worker’s kid got sick”. A lot goes on in her life when it comes to work because she changes jobs every few months. I noticed a pattern - she joins a company, tells me how great the work is and how she’s impressing her managers, after 2-3 months, she quits suddenly because of a silly mistake she made during her work or that her managers are rude. So far, she has changed 5 jobs in the last 2 years. I have tried to talk about her work life, her ambitions, future plans but that didn’t go anywhere since she’s working in the same position as a junior accountant despite being in the industry for more than 6 years.

I’m trying to understand her as a person, know her likes and dislikes, her favourite TV shows & movies, her opinions on everyday things, news but no matter which topic I try to talk about, she seems absolutely clueless which leaves me baffled. For instance, I mentioned to her that I started re-watching Friends, Big Bang Theory and she asked me what they are. Then she told me she has never heard or watched any TV shows. She doesn’t have a clue about any of the movie names either - Batman, Dr Strange, Lord of the Rings, Top Gun. Once I told her I’m really excited about the upcoming movie ‘NOPE’ since it is about UFOs, but she had no idea what a UFO is. I told her a UFO means Unidentified flying object and she asked, “What’s that?” I thought to myself maybe she just isn’t interested in TV shows or movies, so I tried to talk about everyday events, and she has no idea about any of that either. We talked about our relationship boundaries, and I mentioned to her that I prefer to be in a monogamous relationship and doesn’t want to be in a polyamorous relationship and she asked me what they mean. A trans person was walking by and she asked me why they are dressed like that, so I told her that’s a trans, but she did not know what that meant either.

During our last date, I told her I’m looking to purchase a car and mentioned to her about the lengthy wait times due to semi-conductor chip shortage and supply chain issues and she asked me what’s the connection between cars and semi-conductors. After explaining that to her, I asked her if I should get a Tesla instead and she asked me what’s a Tesla? I figured some women aren’t remotely interested in cars, so I let it slide.

Talking about world events, geopolitics is something I am passionate about so I started talking about China vs Taiwan and the significance of TSMC but she had no clue what TSMC meant. I tried to talk about everyday events such as food prices going up because of inflation, food shortage because of Russia-Ukraine war. Again, no clue about any of that.

Mind you, she speaks English well and she’s been living here for more than 15 years in a western country whereas I migrated 4 years ago. It’s not that I try to talk about cars, geo-politics, or serious topics but ANY topic I talk about, she’s clueless to the point I have to explain even the basic terms and keywords. She has no general knowledge about anything. So far, I have tried to talk about TV shows, movies, comics, childhood life, future, everyday things but it feels like she’s completely blank.

153,"UPDATE: second update. Asked for help to get a woman’s number at the gym, we had our date this weekend.","First update title: 

UPDATE: Inquired a few weeks ago about asking a women out at the gym. Details in post, including original.

Original post:

I (29M) have noticed a women at my gym who appears to be looking at me more than usual. I find her quite attractive and have wanted to break the ice to start a conversation.. but I have always thought the gym an inappropriate place to do that for a number of reasons (don’t want to interrupt, it’s personal time/space, etc). 

My question is kind of a two parter - 1. is it ever appropriate, and 2. If so, should I just ask for her number to talk later, or would it be better to make small talk there first?

Apologies if this is long winded but I appreciate any thoughtful incite. Thank you!

UPDATE (first):

Okay, so it’s been a hot minute since this post. We started chatting in person a couple days after posting, long story short she is coming over for a home cooked meal and our first date this weekend. Thanks for the well wishes and support everyone!

End of the day what seemed to work was stealing a few smiles before asking about some crazy back workout she was doing. That was the ice breaker, started making small talk until yesterday when I got her number and asked her on a date.


UPDATE (second): well as promised I am writing an update following the date. I am a Reddit noob and have never done a multi update post, sorry if the format is poor.

Date was phenomenal. We had incredible chemistry, initial awkwardness was very short-lived as we got to know one another better. 

I made us butter chicken for dinner, she brought some baked goods for dessert. Things got heated but we agreed to mostly keep the clothes on and not rush anything. She will be coming back over in a few days.

I’m an awkward guy, and it is not often that a date feels this organic. Thank you very much everyone for the support and help leading up to this - r/dating-advice y’all are the MVPs of my weekend. Besides my date of course.

Edit: wanted to say I really appreciate the support and kind words and encouragement everyone! Also just realized I’ve been given a few awards - thank you kindly!

Edit #2: thank you again everyone for the support, this post really blew up. I got my first ever awards also, so thank you very much for that strangers! There are lots of great comments I am feeling dorky replying the same “Thank you!” To everything, please know it applies to all of you.

A day after I told her this, she texted me saying that there was someone else she was feeling confused about. Long story short I was really hurt and sad. I bid her goodbye and explained I can't be friends with her because I liked her too much. And I was just too hurt.

I unfollowed her on Instagram but she stills follows me and actively views my stories.

Sorry if it's a bit long I'm not too sure how reddit works, I'm quite new here, just wanted to hear what y'all think. Esp other females who may understand my ex date better haha.

156,People say no one is busier than someone who isn’t interested in you but I take hours to reply to people I genuinely like out of fear of rejection.,"Just wanted to leave this sort of devils advocate post here.

Even with people I’m genuinely very interested in I will take ages to reply. It might be a sort of control thing like “If I’m the one not replying to them, they can’t ‘not reply’ to me” and I suppose the quicker I reply the quicker they get to know me better and can decide they want nothing to do with me which would hurt.

At the same time it might also be “the quicker i get to know them, the quicker I might end up in a relationship” which is likely to be a lot of pain and hellishness going off previous experiences so best to avoid.

After typing this out I actually see this doesn’t seem very healthy and maybe it’s just me that’s the problem.

158,Casual sex isn't that important,"Some of you overthink virginity. It really isn't a bad thing to be a virgin. Not everyone gets the opportunity to have sex and some don't want to do so until they are married or in a very established romantic relationship. You're not a loser if you haven't had sex in college, after college, in high school, after your 20s, after your 30s, after your 40s, etc. I blame the way some people have glorified casual sex as if it's a major accomplishment, especially men because other men feel less than because of it. I've had other guys feel sincerely bad for me for being a virgin and they acted like I told them I had a terminal illness. It's weird. I'm not bashing sex before marriage or casual sex, but stop being hard on yourself for it. It's not that important. I've even seen someone on Reddit say they'd kill themself if they were a virgin at 40.

159,Slept with a friend and have been ghosted it seems.,"I would like to start off by saying I had been celibate for 4 years before this happened after a very messy break up from an extremely abusive relationship. I met said guy through a mutual friend who is a very good friend of both of ours. It did not start off as matchmaking or anything. His car had broken down and he was stranded while I was hanging out with my friend who asked if we could give him a ride.

He seemed really nice and funny. We joked around a lot. We started all three hanging out and doing more things together. He got my number from our friend and started sending really flirty and sweet messages. I started to let my guard down and he was aware of the situation I had been in as my friend had told him.

He would call or text me a lot and was always sweet and made me feel good about myself. Saturday he had just gotten a new place and asked if I wanted to come over for a while. I went and after a few hours of talking and laughing he kissed me and then we ended up having sex. He was saying really romantic things. I don't want to say I fell in love with him or anything but I did develop some more intense feelings. I realize this is partly because I had been celibate for so long and intimacy is a big thing for me. When I left he walked me to my car and kissed me again. Texted me to make sure I made it home safely and say goodnight. 

I did not hear from him the next day. I ran into him by accident the day after with our other friend. I did not mention anything about this to our mutual friend. He not only wouldn't look at me but was extremely cold. I was trying to be optimistic thinking he may be having a bad day. I wasn't trying to force anyone into a relationship and I know I didn't give off clingy vibes, mainly because I'm too afraid to. Hours later he sends me a text that is confusing stating that I'm amazing and he doesn't want me to feel like he was using me, that I'm lovely and delicate and have a big heart that he respects and cares for. Wishes me a good night.

He has not said a word to me since. I have seen him twice and he completely ignores me. I'm really hurt and I don't understand. Our mutual friend today told me that I came up in conversation and he asked the guy if he had heard from me and he said ""she's probably mad at me.""  Gave no further detail. 

I am mad. I'm pissed off. I feel used after swearing I'd never let anyone treat me badly again. I didn't anticipate sleeping with him. I understand if someone doesn't want to be in a relationship but I never asked for one. It's so disrespectful. Why do people do this? How hard is it to make a call or write out a freaking I'm sorry I'm not interested text?

I feel like something is wrong with me. Self esteem crushed again. Any advice?

I’m of Asian descent and made a joke of whether he likes Asian (referring to food but also a slight euphemism). He goes silent. 

It didn’t really cross my mind before but since he went silent on my joke, it made me think whether the joke was inappropriate or if he really does have a thing for Asians only.

162,Kiss Rejected because I asked - What to do now?,"I (27M) been dating someone (26F) for a couple weeks now, and it's gone very well for the most part. Seen each other 3 times total, long walks, dinner, drinks, started holding hands from first date, a lot of laughs and generally good vibes. 

However, I'm a massive wuss when it comes for going for the kiss, even though logically I know it would have been fine if I had just gone for it without asking, but guys, I know I messed up, and I asked at the end of 3rd date after dropping her home. I kept laughing cause I was nervous, so I ruined the moment and it didn't happen (disaster I know), so she said ""next time, don't ask"", and I'm feeling a bit shot down. She texted me after saying thanks for the date and getting her home .etc

Feeling pretty crap regarding confidence, but just wondering if I should just continue as normal, don't bring it up, and just go for it next time? I feel like that's the right move, what do you think?

Thanks everyone


UPDATE:

Wow thank you everyone for the uplifting and encouraging words, I really can't describe just how much it's helped me gain a new perspective on the situation! I wish I could find the time to reply to everyone, so please know I appreciate all of you. 

She texted me this evening to spark conversation, I've asked her out again and we are going to do Go-Karting this weekend, so I guess you guys were right, it's still going well! Will make Reddit proud and just go for the kiss this time!

164,She left for another man at the club.. feels bad,"To keep it short I invited this girl for my bday yesterday. We officially met last weekend but we went to the same college. 

Anyway it seemed like whoever gave her attention was who she was going for. We made out and were talking all night. I go on the dance floor with my friends. She was talking to one of my other friend. They were right behind a section of a group of men. My friend said she told him she wants to tell one of them he’s cute. He told her if she does he’s out, she does anyway and he walks away from her. I was watching the whole thing on the dance floor. 

She started talking to the dude and he invited her to their table. And that was that.

I didn’t go up to her, I kept dancing, we didn’t talk again and eventually left a little early. Didn’t message her or anything.

I’m not really upset, just feel disrespected. I don’t plan on contacting her ever again. If she messages me I’ll tell her I felt disrespected by her actions and I have no desire to talk to her.

Edit: Just want to add I don’t think she owes me absolutely anything. Which is why I didn’t say anything to her yesterday nor do I plan on saying anything at all. That would be totally out of place. I’ve been around long enough to understand it just means she’s not that into me. Which is okay. I’m not into her anymore after that. I felt it was disrespectful and I always say someone can disrespect me once, but a second time means I’m disrespecting myself and I did that my younger years and promised to never allow that again. Overall I feel good, I had fun, I didn’t get fucked up last night so no hangover and I’m heading out with my boys tonight.

Edit 2: she send a message apologizing and saying she felt like we were getting close and that “scared” her. I’m probably just going to like the message and move on. Or saying something like “all good, no worries”

Ultimately, they vouched for me with her after I left.

Also, my other girl friends had told me that I am a nice person and a gentlemen since my college days.

167,7 things that changed my dating life...,"Hey guys.

I recently decided to whip up a bunch of the lessons I've learned in my dating life that has led to pretty strong and consistent success. I wrote it in my personal notes but I decided to share it with you all.

Bear in mind that I'm a heterosexual man speaking purely from experience. I might write a post on each of these if you guys are interested.

Here they be...

1. **Practice a ""revolving door"" mindset in the beginning.** On your path to finding a great woman, you will be rejected and ghosted countless times. When this happens, just repeat ""next"" in your mind and let it go. Move on. It's great to be emotionally invested after you've been on a few dates, but if you're invested immediately? It's a turn off to her and a sign of low self-worth in you.
2. **Build an emotionally supportive social circle.** If you make a woman the emotional centre of your world, you're in for a bumpy ride. I got cheated on twice for this exact reason. I became way too needy because I didn't have that solid social foundation. Making her the emotional centre of your world makes it hard to attract new women consistently (they will sniff out the neediness) and it will cripple any relationship you will get into in the future (even marriages end because of this).
3. **Stop trying to be someone else. Find your unique vibe & own it.** This comes from consistently building self-awareness over time. Figure out what you uniquely bring to the table. Maybe you have a dark sense of humour. Stop hiding it. Maybe you're cheeky. Be that. Geeky and analytical? Then fully embrace it (I once met a skinny geek dude who had two girlfriends).
4. **Laugh at yourself occasionally.** One of the biggest confidence hacks I've ever implemented is becoming painfully aware of my shortcomings - and consistently developing the capacity to laugh at them. One caveat though, if it's all you do you will cultivate a self-image as ""court jester"" which won't do you any favours. Being able to laugh at yourself means you will pass 90% of the shit tests she gives you and you'll have way more fun on dates.
5. **Change your relationship to anxiety.** Honestly, I've never delved that deeply into social skills from the perspective of what to say and how to say it. This is because I noticed early on that 80% of all social success I experienced was down to how **present** I was in the moment. If you're present, you just know what to say. You're more relaxed and more confident. People sense it. If you can overcome anxiety by using what I call the FAB model (Fuck it. Allow it. Bring it on) then honestly this will be a game-changer. It was for me.
6. **Become aware of and own your desires.** You want to see her naked. You want to have sex with her. You want to be intimate with her and kiss her and all the rest of it. If you're on a date with her, she likely suspects this at the very least. It's remarkable how many guys hide these desires from her and themselves. It serves no purpose other than dishonesty, unclear intentions and poor communication. If you own your desires and see them not as filthy, wrong or shameful - but life-affirming and beautiful ... you will have far less of a problem with escalating physically through touch or even direct speech. Necessary to avoid the friendzone.
7. **Remember this - you are on the same team as her.** You both want the same thing. Intimacy. Fun. Great sex. Connection. Play. It's helpful to remember that a date is like a co-crafted experiment. You're seeing if you can help each other get what you both want. This mindset shift makes you less nervous because you don't have this subtle ""me vs her"" mentality. You're partners on the same team. I say this because the amount of resentment towards women online from emotionally wounded men makes me sad and slightly nervous. It cripples your chances, too.

That's it. Hope it helps.

Take care.

168,Hey fellow women: Don’t touch men without their consent,"Just wanted to pop on here to draw attention to an issue. 

My (24F) partner (24M) was out and about doing errands one night and had his butt slapped in a store. He was bending over to get something off the shelf. At no point had he ever seen this girl before, and did not want this to happen at all. 

Look I get it. He’s attractive. You’re trying to be funny, and maybe hoping he would like that sense of humor. (edit: for those confused, this was a joke. Not a sad attempt to brag. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.) But that’s not an invitation to touch another person inappropriately without their consent. That’s sexual harassment. 

This happened another time in a clubish setting, (which makes slightly more sense) but we were dancing together and were clearly a couple and some girl slapped/grabbed his butt. 

Women don’t like it when men do that, so what in the hell makes you think a man would like it? 

Respect each other’s personal space please. You might have more luck getting a date by saying hello first instead.

Edit and in a comment I posted below: This post isn’t intended to be a one gender has it worse than another. 

Although, I think women (like myself) often forget that this emotionally affects men just as much as it does women. I’ve definitely been sexually harassed by men. But that doesn’t mean that I have it worse, or that they deserve to experience it because we do. We should have equal amounts of intolerance for this issue no matter what your gender identity is.

This was merely meant to draw attention to the lack of empathy men get when being sexually harassed. 

Nobody should be touched without consent ever.",s37tak,1606,220,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/s37tak/hey_fellow_women_dont_touch_men_without_their/
169,He didn’t pay for third date,"So on our first date I ordered one drink and he paid for it. No food nothing else. On our second date both of us got food so I paid for it, and he got something expensive. No big deal. He then told me thanks and that was nice and he’ll get us next time. He also mentions how he’ll drive us for the next date as well. So next date comes around and he asks if I want to drive and I say no because of what he said before. 

Then at the restaurant he says I probably should’ve drove because he had a few drinks. I then reminded him that he offered to drive us this time, and he said he was joking. Then when the bill comes he puts it on his card so I thought he was going to pay for everything. Then asks me to Venmo him. 

I’m a bit annoyed at this because why say things you don’t mean. Obviously I can afford to pay for dinners but it’s the lack of wanting to after just meeting me. Along with saying you got us next time then you don’t. I don’t even know if it’s worth mentioning this to him or just breaking it off.",wndc8m,1591,411,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wndc8m/he_didnt_pay_for_third_date/

171,First cold-approach today: Got rejected and surprisingly the world has not come to an end lol,"I'm a 25yo M who has recently ditched the dating apps and embraced the ""in-person"" approach.

I was at an art museum today. I enjoy both art and museums. It was a great vibe and I was really feeling it.

I turned a corner and there she stood. She was really pretty. Dyed hair, tattoos, great style and outfit. She was admiring an interesting painting. My type!

In the past, there were episodes when I chickened out or bailed last minute. But today was different.

I had never felt so certain of approaching someone. There was not even a hint of apprehension. I went over.

Me - ""Hey excuse me? Hi I really like the color of your hair""

Her - ""Oh thanks :)""

\-- Ice broken. Chatted about the paintings, favorite exhibit, hobbies etc. approximately 10min

\-- Good energy, laughs, smiles

\-- Didn't want to take up too much time so jumped to the chase

Me - ""I'll be honest I came over because I thought you were really cute and wanted to introduce myself. Can I get your number?""

Well it turned out that she was there with her girlfriend lol. But she was kind about it which I really appreciated. I said I hope you take it as a compliment and have a nice day.

Despite getting rejected I am on cloud 9 which is surprising because earlier I used to think rejection is the end of the world. Its so fulfilling and my confidence is through the roof! I know its just a matter of time till I find the one.

Posting this in case someone's on the fence and needs some real-world inspiration about shooting their shot, the answer is shoot your shot it's gonna be fine!

Edit: Thanks for all the positive feedback! I really appreciate it :)

* Saw a few comments about her lying / referring her female friend as ""girlfriend"", I don't think it matters. It was ultimately a ""No"" so no point analyzing it.
* Saw the advice about providing my number instead, I have to admit it sounds interesting and I'm definitely giving it a shot next time. 
* I also see why some people might call this creepy / thirsty behavior and I had this apprehension before. Then I realized no matter what I do, there's always gonna be that someone who thinks that. That's ok I made my peace with it. Just out here trying to find that happily-ever-after kinda love :) Knew it was not gonna be easy lol.

173,It's crazy how much looks make a difference,"This is just something I have noticed throughout my dating career. Back in the day during college, women would not give me the time of day. I used to wear glasses, was a little bit chubbier, had a bad haircut. Whenever I would hit on women or approach women, I didn't get much success. I never went for the cheesy pickup lines, if I was at a nightclub, I would just approach a girl with a nice smile and say ""Hey I think you are cute, what's your name""? When I tried the same thing in my classes, girls would say ""Aw thanks but I have a boyfriend/not interested"".

I glew up a lot after college. I got contacts, I got better fitting and more stylish clothes, I got a haircut that suits my face better. And the difference is staggering. My success rate when approaching women is 2/3 of the time, when back in the day it was like 1/15. I went to a nightclub this past Halloween weekend, and said the exact same shit I would say in college, and it works like a charm. I immediately see their smile, their reaction, and it just got me thinking. 

No matter what people say, looks is the baseline factor when determining attractiveness. It actually is kind of sad. It makes me feel for a lot of guys.",yio6jb,1577,403,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/yio6jb/its_crazy_how_much_looks_make_a_difference/

I’m 28f and I’m not sure if I’m old school or not but causal sex isn’t my thing. Unless we’re intertwined and we have serious connection which from my experience has taken months for me to develop not days. 

I take sex serious and who I share my body with serious , I personally feel when you have sex with someone you interchange energy and I’m not about to just do it with anyone after 3 dates. 

I’ve had 2 guys so far who have wined and tried to coerce me into being sexual after 3 dates, I even offer to pay half or go on free dates so the whole money power play isn’t a thing.

178,How to get over that feeling of attachment after sex?,"I don't think it needs much explanation, but to put things in context, the girl I was seeing made it pretty clear that she broke up few months back and she doesn't want anything serious. 

I on the other hand don't do casual (or didn't so far) but I was kind of going with the flow. And I won't lie, all that affection and cuteness and hanging out did feel good. It felt ""real"" if you know what I mean. To the point that I kind of started falling for her. Fast forward to few days back we had sex and I feel like my feelings towards her have grown 10 folds.  And she knows this. 

Today I got to know she went out with another one of her guy friends and spent an entire day with him. 
I know I sound possessive. But that's where I need help. I mean she was pretty clear that this was casual. Yet I did this to myself. Now how do I get over her.

179,Does coffee after a date mean sex?,"Had this discussion recently with a friend. Does having someone over for coffee after a date mean mean sex?

180,"GF wants too much money, else she accuses me of greed/avarice","31 y.o, male here.
I've just met that new blonde beautiful woman, 28, She's a mother of a 4 y.o daughter.
I love her daughter. I bought her many games and every week we go with my GF and her kid to a pool or a beach and the kid is very happy...

Now the problem my GF just has too many requests/needs/problems. We already went shopping for my GF's mother and bought all what she needs for her home (I paid of course). My GF has a list of clothes she needs to buy .. she wants me to take her to visit another city... that's just too much for me.

I've already shown her my account it's almost empty (because of her habits). I'm just a teacher I can't afford to live like that. 

Something just tells me to go away... But I've asked a close female friend and she said it's normal? I feel this beautiful woman is just exploiting me... :(

Edit : Thank you very much. I am creating some distance now we're rarely talking (or maybe she's waiting for my next monthly pay lol). I'm not perfect, not ugly, not attractive either. 

I first approached her for her looks but I wanted this to turn into a real relationship.

181,How do you ask to hookup with someone?,"I (21M) recently started talking to an old junior college friend (21F) on Instagram. We definitely flirted a lot over text and it wasn't like innocent flirting. A little bit of dirty flirting also happens now and then. So i feel like she's interested. I've never done this before so idk how to ask her though. How do I ask her if she's interested in hooking up with me or having something casual with me without creeping her out or being a jerk? I just got out of a relationship so I'm not looking for another one anytime soon. Just tryna have some fun.

182,I've used Hinge for a year. This is what it's like:,"I'm a male.

1) I have to have a very good profile.  Good pictures and a relationship oriented profile with a witty response to one of the prompts.  If my profile is just okay, I simply won't get any dates.  

2) I have to make her laugh, witty banter with her, ask her out on a date, logistically plan the date, pay for the date, ask her out on a second date and so on.

3) I have to break the touch barrier.  That burden is on me.  I have initiate the hugging, hand holding, kissing, making out and sex.  If I fail to do so, in a limited window of time of usually a couple of dates, I 100 percent wake up to a text message saying ""you're a great guy, but I'm just not feeling it is all.""  That window of time is real.  If you're not at least making out by the 3rd date because you get caught up in your head, hello friend zone.

4) Dating starts feeling disingenuous.  Same places, same stories, same photos I show on my phone, and the same timing.

There's this thai restaurant that I has never lead to a second date.  I now know to never go there even though the food is good.  I think the lighting makes my face look bad or something.

There's this Boba place next to a nice park that leads to a 50 percent chance of a second date.  This is my go to first date spot.

Greet with hug, open door, recommend the Coconut tea, hop in my car and drive up the street to the park and sit next to her on this park bench under a tree.  Chat some, ask to walk around  a bit hold her hand.  Ask if I can walk her back to her car, and if I get a ""yeah!"" kiss her goodbye.

Then text ""hope you made it home safely.  It was really nice getting to know you more.

The 3rd date is the ""production date.""  I pick her up at her house and drive up to this mountain lake.  This is the date where, if we're not at least heavily making out, it's done.  This is the date that's suppose to lead to sex.


It feels like playing the first few levels of a video game over and over.  Completely disingenuous, but if I just wing it going to random places instead, I have a much worse outcome I've noticed.
 

5) Never having any honest closure if things don't work out.  Either a ghost or a cliche rejection.  She could literally be a surgeon who tells people they'll never be able to walk again, yet she can't tell a guy off of Hinge what wasn't working for her.  Frustrating.

6) Going through dry spells where I'm just met with total indifference and rejection.

7) I'm sometimes treated as a checklist.  I call these women ""finish line women.""  They typically ask a lot of questions indirectly about my finances.  The first date feels like a legal deposition.  

8) Sometimes I don't do anything wrong at all, but she just gets curious about her other 250 Hinge matches, so I'm kicked to the curb.

9) When my ex and I broke up, we both made a Hinge.  She met a ""cute Canadian guy with an awesome puppy"" in one week.  I'm still in first date purgatory a year later.",vqmjl5,1543,345,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vqmjl5/ive_used_hinge_for_a_year_this_is_what_its_like/
183,"HELP Is it weird that he called me ""his"" after 2 days of talking ?","I matched a guy on Hinge 4 days ago.

On Day 2, he made me talk to his friends without any previous warning and told me he really liked me and wanted to learn more about me. He asked if we could meet face-to-face in the 2 following weeks. His last message that Day was ""Good night, mine"".

On Day 3, he sent me a couple of pictures that I didn't open yet and sent me his phone number.

Now we are on Day 4 and I don't know what to do. We have never met but he's already freaking me out. The fact that he called me ""his"" is something I can get past. Even under normal circumstances, I don't like being treated as someone else's property but here, we only talked for 2 days.

185,UPDATE: My crush helped me move and I had the best day of my life,"24M-24F

This is a follow-up to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/r7zyyn/the_girl_i_like_offers_to_help_me_move_should_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I only accepted her help thanks to many people's encouragement, so it's only fair that I give you guys an update.

Tl;dr: We had a blast!

As many questioned why I didn't rent a van, I should have mentioned that I live in an European city with great public transport and I was merely moving from one student dormitory to another, so a few suitcases and bags were all I had, and we successfully got everything in one go because I had already brought some stuff there by myself.

I took up her offer and she seemed quite happy to hear that. When I asked if she had anything else to do that day, she said no and even offered to help clean my new room! Like who offers such a thing?! Anyway she came to my old apartment and we just dragged those suitcases to my new place by subway. I introduced her to the balcony and the new big TV I got. I may or may not have told her we could watch some movies here in the future. Then, she helped me set up the bed and pillows while we talked about the texture and choice of color of my bed sheets. 

Afterwards I finally gathered the courage to ask if I could take her to a cafe as a thank you and she agreed immediately. We strolled through the city while discovering interesting shops. At the cafe we ordered two cups of coffee and two picees of cake, which we shared together. The conversation just never dried up! While we're talking I got a good chance to observe her body language. She fidgeted with the strings on her hoodie so much that it became a bit distracting lol. I mentioned many activities we could do (I didn't say ""we"" specifically though) and she seemed excited about all of them.

We spent almost two hours there and then took another stroll to the subway station where we parted ways. I prepared a list of conversation topics, but ended up not using it because we never ran out of things to talk about. It just felt so natural and we laughed a lot. It was truly wonderful and I didn't need help to figure out she was enjoying it as well. I didn't make any moves except maybe looking straight into her eyes as she spoke, because we're both a bit shy and it's probably best to take it slow.

All in all, it went perfectly and my feelings for her grew, but in a simmering, not burning way. I just felt so relaxed and happy with her. If there's one thing I learned, it's that we shouldn't be discouraged because she didn't show all ""Top 10 signs she's into you"". My crush reponds to texts slowly, but I speculate she just only checks her phone occasionally.

Thank you all who encouraged me to accept the offer! I hope your relationship and mine flourish!",rcoguj,1539,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rcoguj/update_my_crush_helped_me_move_and_i_had_the_best/
186,Dispensary girl started throwing green flags.,"I've been going to this dispensary after just moving to Nevada and there's this employee there that always manages to lock eyes with me. I finally happen to have her check me out at the register and she goes "" you're colorblind?!"" and I was pretty shaken by that initially. I have a hard time making out certain colors when they're close together. One time another employee was helping me get checked out and I couldn't make out the colors for the different strains..so I guess they put in my customer profile that I needed special assistance cause I'm colorblind (lmao).  I pretty much tell her I am to which she replies "" that is so adorable"" and goes on to tell me how I see the world how I should see it. The next time I go in I decide to fire back. I walk right up to her at the register saying I was scared she might have left because I saw the hiring sign outside. We go on back and forth and she mentions its her Friday that day. I ask her what she usually does when she's off and she says ""Usually just clean, smoke and paint. I don't really do much since I broke up with my ex""..that line threw me off hardcore so I tensed up, said my byes and left. Should I just straight up ask for her number at this point? lol

Edit: did not think that this was gonna get as much attention as it did. Thank you all for your input! i feel very much obligated to keep everyone updated that cares for it.

187,"When, or if, to tell a person you're dating about your red flag of sexual history?","29[M] here. Really giving a try with this dating thing. I've gone out twice with this woman that I want to keep seeing. We seem to be on the same page about a lot of things. Limited romantic experience for both of us, but want to date.  Sexually we've had fun once, and want to keep doing that but also the whole learning about each other thing. Aligned goals, home ownership, kids a few years down the line. Aligned values as well which is a pretty big deal to me. She's told her family about me, and when she told me that I did the same. That doesn't feel like something you'd do for someone you just like having sex with. Feels a little early, but ive literally never had a third date in my life so what do i know. And here comes the red flags.

This isnt a brag, I've had many partners. All of them have been professionals, except one now I suppose. Escorts, service providers, sex workers, pick your descriptor. I feel like I'd be being dishonest if I didn't tell her that part of my past. Hell it's only been a few weeks since my last trip into the city to see a provider. And ive got a time scheduled to see one that I now want to cancel. I'm in therapy and my therapist knows about that part of my life, and that I want to put it behind me forever. I can't see her (therapist) for another 2 weeks. 

But it's also an ENORMOUS red flag I think. Do I bring it up? I don't want to scare her off. I've sunk many thousands of dollars into being more than a little pathetic, in fact it's the sole reason I'm so broke to this day, but I am on the road to financial well-being. Cash advance on a massive credit limit, horny and lonely is a horrid combination. 

I'm seeing her tonight, so I don't have super long to overthink the hell out of this. I could maybe ask about her immediate deal breakers? And if its one of them, or adjacent to one of them, fess up and get it out of the way so as to not lie and hurt her down the line when it inevitably comes out.",vsqk6h,1532,526,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vsqk6h/when_or_if_to_tell_a_person_youre_dating_about/

193,Being datable on paper is not the same as making a connection,"I see so many posts that are like ""I am conventionally attractive and fit, and have hobbies, a fulfilling social life, and a good job/education, why is no one ever interested in me romantically?"" And I know the assumption is maybe they're an asshole, but lots of these posters don't seem to be assholes. They're just genuinely confused why they never develop romantic connections despite being what society says you have to be to be datable.

As much as people like to rate people based on their socioeconomic status, conventional attractiveness, and usefulness to society and whatnot, what picking a partner comes down to at the end of the day is *connection* and how intimate and fulfilling it is. Most people want passion more than they simply want a functional human. And while finances, education and appearance are part of the decision-making process, they're more like a bar to weed out incompatible partners and are not as important as individuality. Most people aren't trying to hit the highest score possible in every possible stat a person can have, because even if they find that person with the highest score, they may feel nothing for them. Only the most empty people choose their partners solely for those things.

Wanting someone to be romantically interested in you because of your job or education or looks and not your youness is just begging for a shallow transactional relationship with a shallow person.",rw2djm,1502,225,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rw2djm/being_datable_on_paper_is_not_the_same_as_making/

200,Why do men run away after making out with me in clubs?,"So this is this second time this has happened to me (24f). Last night I got super drunk and made out with a guy at the club. After we were done, I asked for his social media and he just said, ""Yeah, sure"" right before running away. Why do guys do this? Is it because they realize that I'm not as attractive as they thought? Does it scare them off? Are they just not looking to keep in contact? Did I drunkenly initiate the makeout session without realizing it and the guy didn't actually want to do it?

Update: Just to clarify, no I am not looking for anything serious. I'm also a college student attending a big school with a large party scene where hookup culture is also a thing and people often ask for socials over phone numbers at clubs. I didn't realize asking for socials was not the norm among other demographic groups, whether it's age, geographic location, occupation/education status, etc. I ask for socials, not because I am looking for something serious, but because I'd like to get a better idea of what they look like and who they are, and can have the time to contemplate before hooking up, to reduce the chances of regret. I simply like to have fun with men and believe it or not, I am selective about who I have sex with, hookup or otherwise.",swf31w,1454,575,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/swf31w/why_do_men_run_away_after_making_out_with_me_in/

202,Women just want to feel comfortable,"I’ve asked all the women I’ve dated what attracted them to me and the most common answer was how comfortable I made them feel. I know it sounds like common sense but too many men overlook something so crucial to attraction and dating. When you have ulterior motives, when you overthink a date, girls can sense that shit a mile away even down to a subconscious level. Don’t create a persona during texting that you can’t match in person. Don’t have expectations before or during a date, don’t let the thought of sex and what’s underneath her clothes consume your mind.

 If a girl genuinely feels comfortable with you, it’s so hard to fuck things up. Be respectful, be kind, don’t be afraid of eye contact, STOP trying to be cool, don’t bombard her with compliments, talk about your passions and listen to her speak, understand her story. Again, all these things sound so obvious but you’ll be surprised how rare it is for women to find this nowadays. The last thing you want is a girl to reject you for someone you’re not.

203,Guy called a video of 5-year-old me dancing hot.,"I am an 18(f). I have been talking to a guy and he is 22 and we were exchanging old pictures and I had sent him a video of me dancing when I was 5 years old and he said I look hot. I don't want to overthink but I am very creeped out by this comment and I don't know how to react or respond. What do I do?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I did reply with ""Gosh, No I was only 5"" to his text and he replied with "" \*\*cute"" which means he is changing his compliment from hot to cute. I am still clueless as to how to feel about this.

Thank you everybody for your responses. To provide more context on the basis of responses that I have received till now, he was definitely not being sarcastic as he had sent it with a heart emoji. For the people asking more context about him, I met him through online dating and I have known him for around 3 months. He does tend to say uncomfortable things at times, not in a ""child predator"" way but in a  sexual way but I have been looking past that. I was slightly creeped out by his compliment yesterday and I didn't know how to address the situation without sounding like ""I think you are a pedo"" and regarding the sending video thing, it is considered pretty normal in here to share pictures of your childhood with a person that you are talking to, be it a friend or somebody you are dating. He is obviously not some 60-year-old man looking for child pictures. Going forward I think I would just like to keep a check on him cause there is just no way to address the situation really IMO.

204,"So many women complain that guys just want to fuck and duck, but I've been ghosted multiple times for not being sexual enough on the 1st or 2nd date","And I know that because some women have told me they thought I wasn't interested because I didn't try to kiss them on the first date (even though some of these were just brunch or lunch dates) or because I didn't try to rip their pants off on the second date (even though they seemed reserved and shy)

I'm not a prude or anything on dates but I generally take things more slowly and like to wait for clear signs that she wants me to proceed rather than just rushing in with my big slobbery smoochers or dry humping her at the bar etc like some guys do.

Have these women I've met been conditioned into believing that if a guy doesn't try to tear their clothes off then he must not be interested because of all the horny apes out there (who the women on this sub often complain about)?

205,Why is being boring bad?,"Recently a girl I really liked said behind my back that I was boring. People have commented that my dating profile appears boring which is causing me to get no matches. But tbh I don't see any issue with the way I'm living right now. I'm just doing activities that bring me joy. The activities that bring me joy are TV, youtube, food, news, gym, and reddit. Every now and then I'll go traveling or go on camping trip but it's kind of expensive. To the average girl this seems boring but I don't see any issue.

Even my job is perceived as boring to other people. It's a stable government job. I have a business that I work on the side a lot but it's very technical and most people don't understand

So why do most men have to present themselves as interesting when most of us live pretty boring lives? Why is there this constant need to be interesting?

I just feel like the world needs more boring stable people right now with all the chaos.",rntzzl,1433,320,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rntzzl/why_is_being_boring_bad/
206,I just heard the greatest thing a date could possibly tell me,"Had an unexpectedly fantastic first date on Saturday which was supposed to be a couple of hours in the afternoon at a board games bar and ended up being a big night out including going to karaoke at 1am and finishing at mine.

We didn't have sex but she stayed with me and I made a point of checking in with her at various points, letting her take the lead and making sure she was happy with anything new we started doing. She shared with me that she's very inexperienced sexually (she's 30F, I'm 35M) so I felt an even greater responsibility to ensure the experiences were positive and that she felt as much control in the situation as possible.

Texting about it last night and she said 'you made me feel so comfortable' and friends, seeing that comment was one of the best feelings I've ever had in my dating life. 

I've had to do a lot of work the last couple of years in terms of being the kind of partner I want to be following my last breakup where I realised how self involved I'd been a lot of the time, and much of that has been around improving my communication in every sense. So to get a comment like that was so affirming and I wanted to share it.

Being the sort of partner who checks in regularly, who actively creates space for any hesitations or objections to be voiced is mostly for your partner's benefit, but it comes with a great knock on effect which is that you'll feel like a million dollars about it too. I'm conscious this all may just read like a brag but I just think it's worth reiterating how important this kind of thing is and the benefits to all.",ucapwi,1429,106,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ucapwi/i_just_heard_the_greatest_thing_a_date_could/

208,"Unpopular Dating Opinion: Straight Men of Reddit, You Don't Lose Good Relationships By Being Vulnerable With Your Girlfriend, You End Up In Bad Relationships By Not Being Vulnerable With Her From The Start","This isn't unpopular to the general public, but across Reddit, it's definitely unpopular. Go on to any [r/askmen](https://www.reddit.com/r/askmen/) thread and you'll see the highest upvoted answer to questions about being vulnerable in relationships being some variant of ""I'm not vulnerable with my girlfriend if she sees me cry she'll lose respect/attraction for me"" or ""that's stuff I talk to my therapist with, not my girlfriend."" I view this as an extremely toxic warped view of the way the average straight woman views the man she is dating.

Lots of men have had one bad experience in dating, or heard an anecdotal story about how a guy showed emotion in a relationship and was promptly cheated on. I know of one popular story where a cop cried in front of his girlfriend when his mom died, and she lost attraction and proceeded to cheat on him with his friends. And a lot of guys hear this and think ""I need to not show emotion/vulnerability around my girlfriend, or she'll leave me."" This is where I think otherwise. If you're dating a girl who'd lose attraction and cheat on you because you show understandable emotion about a difficult life moment, then that's not a relationship you want to save. She is not a worthy partner for you. It's good that you found out who she is, and can dump her like she deserves.

In fact, I'd posit that not showing vulnerability up until a major life tragedy was the reason you ended up in this situation to begin with. By not showing vulnerability in the early stages of a relationship, you're going to lose a lot of women who like deeper emotional connections. The ones you have left are going to be ones who don't want emotional men. It's rare to find a woman who wants a completely hardened emotionless man. Most women value emotional intelligence, honesty, & vulnerability, especially modern, successful, independent women. If you're never vulnerable, that sort of girl will never want to date you, and all that's left in your dating pool are disloyal women who only care about their own perception of your masculinity. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

210,Why is it considered rude to order a lemonade on a first date?,"I was on a first date w my now ex. I told him that I want to order a lemonade and he got offended and  told me that if I order a lemonade I would put him in friendzone. I told him several times that I wanted to order lemonade, when we got to the café he ordered a bottle of wine  and didn't let me choose anything else. I was confused.

I was out with another guy , we went to a pub and this time I ordered a lemonade . This guy also was kind of offended by my order , but he didn't say anything. I could see on his face that he was disappointed in some way.

My question is why is it that if you order lemonade on the first date, the guy you're dating automatically assumes that he is  in the friendzone?

Im basically attracted to a chick who works at arcade and I couldnt help but look at her a little too much. Not long creepy stares but a few glances every now and then. Not at her ass or anything, her face is just really beautiful.

Also asked others about info about her instead of just asking her. I personally lack A LOT of exp with this type of stuff  so my confidence always varies. She found out and confronted me and said I was creepy.

214,"He doesn't want sex again because I was ""too easy to get""","After some time of low-key flirting I (23F) had sex with a very attractive friend (21M) after a party. He initiated and albeit not totally crazy, the sex was fine (I liked it and he seemed to be into it too).

Fast forward about two weeks, I was pretty much in lust with him and met him at another party. I expected us to do it again but no luck. By then the situation was kind of bothering me so I decided to be brave and ask him about it straight up. I told him I wasn't romantically interested whatsoever but enjoyed the sex and would be interested in a friends with benefits situation. And that it would of course be totally fine if he wanted or didn't want to and that I just needed clarity.

He said he didn't want to sleep with me again or enter a FWB because he hadn't liked the sex enough. His reasoning:  
\- It had been too easy to get with me  
\- I had seemed to want it ""too much""  
\- He would've preferred more of a ""challenge""/a mysterious partner

He's a very attractive, lowkey narcissistic person with quite an ego (thinks of himself as an ""alpha male"") and so it didn't come as much of a shock, but I'd still like to know your guys's opinions on this reasoning and what makes people think/feel this way. I personally hate the whole ""playing hard to get"" thing, I'd much rather always know where I stand and let the other person know too. For relationships but also casual sex to be honest.

217,Is it really better to be alone than with the wrong person?,"Hi, 20F here. I’m still pretty new to dating, having only started about a year and a half ago as a late bloomer. However, I’ve known for a long time that I am a hopeless romantic. I crave that special connection with someone so badly. I have plenty of friends and I understand that platonic love has a lot to offer, but even with my best friends it feels like I am missing something.

The past three “situationships” I was in all ended poorly. The most recent is what I will focus my question on to prevent this post from becoming too long.

Let’s call him Frank (20M). We met through a mutual friend and went on a date. He seemed nice and we had good chemistry, so we went back to my dorm to make out. The next date is when things went wrong. He wanted to have sex without a condom and I didn’t want to, even though he claimed he would pull out & that he was tested just a month prior.

As soon as I said no, Frank got upset. I was too scared to kick him out. He kept persisting and being very touchy despite what I said, even fingering me while stating how obvious it was that I was turned on. He asked multiple times, and each time I said no but he was just getting increasingly exasperated.

I freaked out and called my roommate to come home and help me kick him out. He texted me the next day apologizing for making me uncomfortable, but I ended things right then and there.

Frank was the last straw for me. I decided to take a break from dating to reassess after all of these bad experiences. Yet I still feel that consistent void of a missing piece. I just want someone to listen to music with and cuddle. 

I was thinking back to how I handled the past 3 people I had gone out with, and wondering if I had been too harsh with them. Regarding Frank, I feel like I made it a big deal and should have just had sex with him.

Looping back to the title of my post, recently it feels like I would rather go back to the people who had “mistreated” me than remain single/alone. I need some guidance navigating this part of dating; are my expectations too high? How do you deal with that void, other than hobbies and friends? Should I be more forgiving of mistakes like this?

Thank you for reading it you made it to the end of this. I truly appreciate any guidance anyone has to offer.

TLDR: Had a lot of bad dating experiences lately. Wondering if I should lower my expectations since I need to fill the void of being lonely.

227,Ghosted her after seeing her kiss another guy,"So I've (28M) been seeing this woman (31F) and been dating her for roughly 6-7 months. We agreed to be exclusive and I thought everything was going well. I really did think she's awesome and felt she thought the same for me.

I was in her area yesterday where she lived and saw her in the park with her dog near her building with another guy. Just seconds later they hugged for quite a while I should say and appeared to be french kissing for a good 5 seconds. His hands were squeezing her ass while he kissed her.

I was quite upset yesterday and decided to confront her about it later. However I am a lot more calm today and have just decided to just ghost her. Am I being unreasonable/drastic in deciding to do so? 

I am not really seeking any reconciliation (edit: and not quite looking for revenge either after seeing some of you assume that's why I am ghosting) and just need to start healing immediately now that I've accepted the situation after seeing it with my own eyes. This is what dating is nowadays, I guess.

Edit #2: I couldn't care less if I'm giving her an excuse that I was a bad guy for ghosting her without her knowing that I knew what she did. For the second time, I'm not looking for revenge nor do I care *specifically* what she thinks or will think of me for doing so. I just would like to move on with my life.

228,Sick of being told that I “must have guys lining up for me” or how “easy” it is for a woman to find a guy but how difficult it is for men when I’m sat here with literally no one interested in me.,"I understand that it’s meant to be a compliment, but it just feels like a slap in the face tbh. This whole idea that women have all the control in dating and have so many more options is just not my reality. Hearing all this just makes me think “well then what the fuck is wrong with me/am I doing wrong.” 

Not much else to say, just a mini rant I guess.

EDIT: thanks so much for everyone’s comments of advice/comforting words and even disagreeing/offering different perspectives! It’s been oddly comforting to know I’m not the only one with this issue (although I’m sorry to hear so many other men and women are struggling). I’ve never got this much response on Reddit before and I’m struggling to keep up with all the comments so wanted to say thanks here!

EDIT 2 (because I’ve seen/had the same discussion occur many times in the comments so I figured a summary might be useful): I didn’t mean for this to turn into a men vs women post, but I can see how it’s got here given my initial post! For the record, I think it’s a really shitty thing that men have to deal with getting no matches on dating apps when dating apps has become the primary dating format, and if I was getting no matches I’d still be on Reddit crying about that probably haha. As many people have pointed out, women tend to get a lot more matches because men are more likely to ‘like’ more women even when they do not have interest in pursuing any kind of relationship. This creates a weird scenario where it seems like women get “loads more interest” but actually they’re not getting any closer to finding someone who wants a relationship at all. Just a lot of matches that mean nothing (and not because they’re rejecting all these matches and ghosting them all. From my experience that’s certainly not what I’m doing anyway). The matches we get on dating apps are about as useful as the likes on instagram - doesn’t really mean much, just someone showing they liked your photo you’ve uploaded, but that’s about as far as the “interest” goes. 

Honestly I didn’t realise until now that other girls were experiencing this, most of my friends are in relationships so I’ve not got them to talk to about it. I feel a bit better that it’s “not just me” but also kind of worried because I’m not sure where to go from here? But anyway this has been a really interesting discussion and sounds like a lot of people are having a shit time with dating.

*Edit 3* : just thought I’d address a few of the same comments/questions I keep getting in the hopes it will stop all the repetitive arguing occurring 😅 

Firstly, I personally do approach men that I find attractive, the general assumption here seems to be that women often don’t, and idk maybe they don’t, but I do and I’ve always been that way! 

Secondly, there seems to be an assumption that I’m getting matched from a bunch of guys and then rejecting them all 🤣 I don’t know where that’s coming from… I get a fair few matches but then none of them are interested in me in the end, not the other way around! 

What tends to happen: A) I message and say hi - they ignore. B) They message me and say hi, we have a conversation for a few days but there’s no talk of meeting in person, so I’ll try and arrange that - they either disappear OR dodge the question but keep intermittently messaging for the next few weeks whenever they feel like they want attention it seems like. C) they ask me to come round to theirs to shag. D) I actually DO get to meet them in person and then after that date (B) part 2 happens - it turns into them just messaging me when they’re bored and putting in no real effort. 

Thirdly, call me stupid but something just doesn’t quite add up with this whole “it’s harder for men to get into a relationship than women” thing… I’m really sorry but it just doesn’t make sense to me. Unless all these women are gay and in relationships with each other, how could women possibly be somehow finding relationships whilst men aren’t? (Obviously talking purely in terms of heterosexual relationships). I’ve seen a few people talk about how women get to have short term relationships with this magical “15% of men that all the women want” but do you really think this is what women are after? To be messed around for a few months at a time by guys who don’t actually like them? It’s crazy…",ybwohv,1361,521,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ybwohv/sick_of_being_told_that_i_must_have_guys_lining/
229,"Guy didn’t know where things were. Is this lack of experience, not caring, lazyness, or what?","
Was seeing a guy and things eventually progressed to physical. He has a shy/introverted personality, so I’m unsure if that has anything to do with it. 

But, when the moment came (no pun intended) in the bedroom I was put off by the fact he didn’t know where things were. For reference he is 34M. 

He’s has had past partners (gfs, etc) where he was in a long term relationship with. So I’m very confused on how that worked out. 

He was rubbing an area that was absolutely nowhere near target site (rubbing corner where my leg connects to groin). Then asked if he was fingering the right hole(Sorry for being graphic). When I asked what he liked, he said “I don’t know.” Things didn’t progress. But, I was left very very very confused. I didn’t want to pry, but I wondered what sex life was during his relationships. I can’t imagine dating someone for 1+ year and not knowing what area you’re touching, specially as a male above his 30s. 

I’m not trying to berate him. I just haven’t come across this before and I didn’t know what to do or say other than “you’re way off” and correct his hand placement (which when hed go back, still was off target).

I don’t want to make him self conscious. But it was a bit of a turn off. And I can’t tell if it’s lack of experience, him being selfish/lazy (I did manage to get him off-not through sex in like 3-4 min), or what….thoughts?",ubp3de,1361,332,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ubp3de/guy_didnt_know_where_things_were_is_this_lack_of/
230,A Woman I met up with lied and said she was Shorter than her actual height??,"I'm 27 M. Met up with a F, 34. 
So we were texting a few months before we finally made plans to meet. She asked me how tall I was And I didn't lie. I told her I was 5'11. 
She told me she was only 5'5 so in my mind I think she is a short girl. But she kept sending Me selfies and she looked at least 5'9 or 5'10. I kept joking with her that she looks really tall for her height and she said it's just because she has long legs. She didn't seem insecure about it at all. We had a laugh over it..

So we meet up and she wasn't even wearing heels and she stood almost even with me. She was at least 5'9. I didn't mention it to her. I personally have no problem with a woman's height because I'm not shallow. but why would a woman lie about being shorter than she actually is ?

We are going on dates, making out, and we have slept in each others place a couple of times.

Yesterday she called me hungover, to tell me she wen't to a party on Saturday, got drunk, and met a guy she knew from university. They kissed and he spent the night at her place, but they didn't have sex. She says she's very sorry, regretting it and needed to tell me to continue dating.

I appreciate her honesty. Tbh I'm not heartbroken, but I don't know how to feel about it. We are not ""official"", BUT we did have a conversation about being exclusive just some days before. (Which she started and which we both agreed on).

234,"At least some of us feel bad, guys","Just had a lovely date with a super sweet guy who works with kids. On paper, he was a perfect match. He’s good at cooking food safe for my specific allergies, skateboards (I’m learning to longboard), politics and values aligned, does artsy stuff on the side, gave me sincere compliments.

The minute I met him I had a sinking feeling. I knew that I didn’t have chemistry with him. I do feel so awful because it must be discouraging. He’s not the best looking guy but that wasn’t it, it was a lot of small things that made the chemistry just not there for me.

So if you’re a guy (or girl!) out there that’s doing everything right but has bad luck with dating, just know that at least some of the people that reject you do have a heart and know you’re human. I’m still thinking about him a day later because I could tell he was very disappointed but still very respectful. I hope there’s someone out there for him because I can tell he had a big heart and deserves to share it!

I’d never expect him/anyone to change to be “good enough” for me and wouldn’t feel right forcing myself and being disingenuous either. Hope this helps someone out there.",tanch8,1331,417,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tanch8/at_least_some_of_us_feel_bad_guys/
235,"6 dates, no kiss","
EDIT: As I suspected he wasn't interested and ghosted me

I (22F) have met a guy (23M) at a party and we've been texting and going out for about 2 months. But I have no clue what his intentions are or if he even likes me because he's been giving me conflicting signals. 

We've been on 6 ""dates"", he has paid for every single meal and drink and has already spent almost 500$ on me. This is a first for me since I'm used to splitting the check, but he always insists on paying and says he was raised this way. 

He works in finance and I work in marketing so we're both pretty busy, we don't text much throughout the day and, admittedly, we're both dry texters.
However,  when we meet we get along and have fun just talking for hours. 

But then again, it's been 2 months and 6 dates and he still has never tried to kiss me or initiated physical contact of any kind. 

I'm too shy to do it myself and I also think he might reject me and it'll be awkward. But I'm also kinda bored and tired of this situation.

238,Where to meet single men in their mid twenties? Seems like they don't exist or leave their homes!,"Edit: wow thank you all so much!!! So what I’ve learned is: this seems to be a gender neutral problem (women are tough to find too), I should find a new gym and approach guys first, Portland isn’t the best place to look, and maybe dating apps aren’t that bad. Thanks for giving me some hope, when I’m ready to date again I have a game plan :) 

I'm newly single (24F) and want to start dating again in a few months.  In the meantime, I've noticed that single men in their twenties don't actually seem to exist?  It's bizarre, I'm a very busy person who is constantly out of the house doing stuff, and everywhere I go I see: women of all ages, men in their 40s and up, and younger men with their wives/girlfriends.  It's scary because how am I supposed to date if I can't even meet a single man in my age range?  I have no options or prospects lol.  For context, I live in Portland OR.  I WFH so sometimes I'll go to a coffee shop to work and there's no men I could talk to.  All women, couples, and much older men.  I also go to church and I've tried out quite a few only to find they are 70% women and 90% of the men there are married or in long term relationships - the single ones are much older and uncomfortably desperate to get married.  Even at my gym (yes I go into the weight room), I'm the youngest person by 15-20 years.  I hike or do some outside activity at least once or twice a week and still don't see men in their 20s who aren't on dates.  I promise you I am not exaggerating or not being observant enough.

In past relationships I've met my ex's friends at get-togethers and thought ""wow so young single men do exist!"" but now that I'm single they disappeared again haha!  Do they just stay home all day?  I am confident in my looks and my personality, but how am I supposed to meet someone I actually like when the pool of options is zero?  I personally don't like dating apps but I'm afraid I will have to resort to that if I literally cannot find a single man to ask out.",rn2im3,1323,790,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rn2im3/where_to_meet_single_men_in_their_mid_twenties/
239,Girl that didn’t want a relationship is now upset with me that I’m walking away and don’t want a friendship.,"Recently I started talking to a girl and we went out on a really nice first date a couple weeks ago.  Since then we had started texting constantly, there was really good chemistry, but she claimed she was too busy to go out a second time.

So, I asked her what her intentions were (because I didn’t want to waste my time and had the feeling we weren’t on the same page) and she told me she didn’t want a relationship right now and wanted to stay friends.  I politely declined saying that I respected her wants, but couldn’t continue things because I ultimately wanted different things and walked away from the situation.

A week later, this weekend, she texted me upset that I dropped off and how she thought it made no sense why I couldn’t look for a relationship while still being her friend.  I told her that I was more than happy talking to her more about our past conversation so she can have a better understanding of the situation and as we discussed it she began to get upset that I didn’t want to be just her friend and how she is trying to force a friendship on me when that’s unfair to both of us.  

She says she doesn’t want to lose a good friend and good connection, but I had to explain to her that I’m coming from a place of romance while she’s coming from a place of friendship.  She claims she doesn’t have feelings for me but the way she’s reacting would say otherwise.  The conversation ended with her frustrated and saying something along the lines of, “alright fine, if you don’t want a friendship, then there’s no friendship here.  It’s fine, bye” and me telling her that I’m just trying to respect her boundaries, expect her to respect mine, thanked her, and if she ever changes her mind about dating, that she knows where to find me.

What is everyone’s thoughts?

Disclaimer, I am NOT looking for advice on how to get this to work out with her.  This is simply to get others opinions on how bizarre this was for me because I have NEVER experienced this.

242,She's pregnant. And it's not mine.,"Ok so, here's a summary between me (17M) and her (16F).
We have been talking over the phone for a month and a bit. Half way through that I asked on her on a date and told her that I really like her. She responded very well, she agreed to the date. We living life. Ok.

Now, last night she texts me saying things that.. honestly make her sound drunk #underagedrinking, lots of references to alcohol, slurred speech. She said she has something to tell me and she starts acting weird. Eventually she says the words ""I'm pregnant with a child"". No context really. I'm not sure if she's been Prego for a while, if it happened last night while she was at a high. She said she was having a fun night with her friends and now she said that.. I don't know what to believe. I told her we'll talk in the morning. 

If she is pregnant what do I even do?
I've known her for just over a month, but we've established such a strong connection.
She had sex with another dude.
She's probably pregnant.
She gets drunk at the age of 16.
I can't help but feel it's her friends being an influence on her.
I'm truely lost for words.

UPDATE: She wasn't drunk, her friends were. They saw her messaging me for a while and then after she went to party and have fun they took her phone. That's a summary of what we spoke about the next morning. I told her this:""I think you should re-evaluate who your friends actually are. Don't mistaken my anger towards yourself, it's not.

243,"I want to be a housewife, and there are men out there that want a housewife, but they want you to have a successful career first, then give it up when you're married. What gives?","

Some context. I am definitely more of a traditionalist when it comes to relationships and marriage. For all the men who will ask, no, I did not save myself for marriage, so let's get that out of the way and focus on what I'm actually asking please. 

So I do want to be a housewife one day. If a man is good to me and takes care of me, nothing makes me feel better than taking care of him. I DO want him to come home to a clean house and a delicious dinner. I do think it is a love language. Act of service. Nurturing. I know there are men out there that want this. 

What I am confused by, is why if you're unemployed (by choice), they don't take you seriously. (I do have a job BTW) From my observations in my own dating life and watching others of over the course of 10 years, it seems they want to find a career woman, and have her stop working when they get married to be a housewife. For me, I don't see the point of running myself in to the ground and building a career just to throw it away, when I want to be a housewife anyways. 

Why is this? Is this about dominance? Taming the tiger and getting her to stay home? I don't know. Just looking for any kind of context here. It seems the consensus is that if you straight up state you're not a career woman and you really just want to stay home and take care of your man, you're lazy. But if you're a career woman, they then want to convince you to leave your job and become a housewife and they'll take care of you.

**edit** assume the woman already has qualities of youthfulness, attractiveness, health, happiness, fertility, femininity, and submissiveness (not tolerating abuse but letting you lead, I'm not going to argue over the definition of submissiveness in traditional male female relationships)

I took the comment as a joke, but later, when we got home, he randomly started to describe the body of one of the girls he had slept with, which I said made me uncomfortable. As a response, he just smiled and continued while making sure we held eye contact. So I said that I could describe the body of one of the people I´ve slept with, but then he started to ""playfully"" choke me. First I thought he would let go, but after a while I felt my face turn red and I struggled to breathe. So I tried to squirm out of his hand while trying to remove it, but he didn´t let go. Of course, he did let go after awhile, but it felt really weird that he would do that. I get that it was supposed to be a joke, but he was so forceful. Afterwards, he also mocked my voice when I had said that I can describe the body of one of the men I´ve slept with  - like I was the inappropriate one. Later on I mentioned that one of the characters in the show I´m watching is submissive, and he said ""You´re also submissive. But sometimes you get too cocky, but then I just remind you of your place"". I´m not sure how to react to all of this, because he said these things like he was joking. Does he just have a bad sense of humour or do you think he means any of this? We´ve been dating for two months.

I feel like never valued or liked me at all, like I’m an inhuman object to them. If I say no, they never contact me again.

Is this just the norm in society now? I don’t even like being touched or kissed, yet that’s all they try to do after a date.

259,Best date of my life,"I posted on here yesterday that I was going on a date with an older woman. I was super nervous because she is much more successful professionally and so much more good looking than me haha. I took some bits of advice that I received on here but nobody could have predicted just how good this date was! We walked to a cafe, laughing and talking all the while, we spent almost 2 hours there over hot chocolate and a pastry, without even realizing. After that, she took me all around town, showing me buildings she thought were ugly, neighborhoods she thought were cute, her old apartment, some decorations in a hotel she was fascinated by, before we went to her apartment. We made out like teenagers before sleeping together. I am leaving the city today, we both knew that beforehand. I wish I didn’t have to go, but this date will forever remain with me. I can still smell her perfume on me and it makes me happy!

EDIT: I have spent all of today just being happy! My 6 hour journey back home felt like breeze because all the while all I could remember was her smile and her eyes. I moved to this country 6 months ago and honestly, those days were insufferable for many reasons. Just spending time with her yesterday has made me fall back in love with myself and life in general. Thank you to everyone for reading, responding, and wishing well of course. Not a goodbye, just a see you later.

UPDATE: While texting today she said she felt comfortable sharing her vulnerabilities with me (some stuff she told me on the date). Never felt more proud of myself :’)",sd7hdn,1260,112,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sd7hdn/best_date_of_my_life/
260,Thoughts on feeling like you were just used for sex,"A very common topic on this sub seems to be that people feel like the person they were in the early stages of dating only used them for sex. Most often, the author writes of going on 1-3 dates with someone, sleeping together, and then either being ghosted or told that their date no longer wants to continue things. Don’t get me wrong, there are certainly people out there that mislead their dates to get laid. And ghosting someone you’re dating is usually wrong, unless it’s a safety thing. However, I want to offer an alternative possibility to some of these situations that’s slightly less cynical, but more difficult to accept: maybe they simply changed their mind after sleeping with you.

For me personally, the first time having sex with someone new is very telling, both in terms of our sexual compatibility and in how I feel about them in the intimate moments afterwards. While sex with a partner certainly gets better over time and as you learn about each other, there have definitely been times where I’ve discovered certain immutable incompatibilities. For instance, some women do not give head— something I really enjoy and would not feel sexually satisfied without in a long-term relationship. Others have differences in sex drive. Are these things that could be worked through? Maybe, but at such an early stage, sometimes it’s easier to just find someone who matches you better. And it’s important to note that one partner can feel as though the sex was amazing while the other didn’t have a good time. It’s easy to not even notice if your partner fakes an orgasm or lies to prevent you from feeling bad.

In addition, post-sex pillow talk after the first time is likely the first instance where you are spending time with your date with little to no sexual tension. AKA “post-nut clarity.” At this point, there are no hormones clouding your judgement of how you feel about the person, and you’re solidifying your determination of how much you vibe with them at their core. There have been times where I’ve been on a few dates with a woman, really enjoyed her company and personality, had sex, and then realized that I just didn’t feel that way about her. It’s very difficult to explain my change in emotions, but I cannot invalidate them. And it was certainly never my intention to use her, I simply felt differently after we slept together.

My advice to people who have the tendency to feel this way would be to communicate, communicate, communicate! Don’t have sex with the expectation that your partner is agreeing to a future relationship. Understand that your partner is still trying to get to know you, just as you are getting to know them. And recognize that deciding to wait longer to have sex solely for the purpose of trying to avoid this merely pushes it to the future and makes it harder to end things if the compatibility isn’t there.

TLDR: having sex with someone new for the first time is still part of the process of getting to know them, and to simplify the end of your relationship as “he/she was just using me for sex” isn’t always fair.

EDIT: thank you for the interesting comments and insights. I think that the widely diverse perspectives on sex in the comments just go to show that compatibility is a really big deal.",whv8z5,1257,326,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/whv8z5/thoughts_on_feeling_like_you_were_just_used_for/

I had no idea what to say, I was so nervous, so I improvised everything.

262,Guy friend (m28) who I thought was sending some signals invited me (f29) on a weekend getaway and never made a move,"Hi. My  guy friend who I have been hanging out with more and more invited me to go to a long weekend trip to a cabin. I assumed this was almost a for sure sign.

It was very calm, we did some outdoor activities, cooked together, watched movies.

whenever we made breakfast he was always very smiley, and also seemed very giddy like glancing at me, and when I would look at him with “?”, he would just smile and shake his head.

But other than maybe somewhat huddling under the blanket together while watching a movie, he never made a move or did anything.

On the way back, he said he was glad I was able to come, we hugged and said bye. He also suggested going to a similar trip again.

I am just wondering what I should think about all of this. Would a guy really bring a girl on a weekend getaway and not try anything ? Am I exactly the same as a platonic male friend?


Edit:

Thank you all for your replies — 

I know probably the easiest to ask or make move myself. I think we are in a delicate situation where the friendship is peaceful and we have a good time together. I am guessing he either feels exactly like that, or he does see me completely as a good platonic friend. Either way the fear of confronting it and being awkward with each other forever is much stronger than the desire to become more than friends.

But I will see how it goes and if the right opportunity arises I will confront it and update.


Edit2:

Really did not think this would get this much attention. It is very interesting to hear everyone’s thoughts and what they think is a “green light”. 

Why I don’t think it is a clear green light:

He has mentioned his “type” before and I do not fit into this at all.

He has a lot of friends that are only couples and now that I think of it it would have been weird to invite them (he would be third wheeling)  or even invite them along with me (too much like double date). He also has told me he gets quite lonely and I imagine that even platonic he could prefer going there with another single friend like me rather than alone or with a couple. 

He was smiley and happy the whole time  but I don’t know if it was just being out in relaxation weekend mode that made him like that.  The stay was at a place his friend owned. He did pay upfront for the car / gas / food / stuff and I told him I’d pay him half, and he said he will let me know how much I owe. 

I haven’t seen him since we got back but we briefly discussed again going on another trip again in the near future.

Again,
I am firmly of the camp of staying good friends than mess something up because I misinterpreted his behavior, it is more important to me to stay like this as a good friend to him if he sees me just as a friend.",ydkv73,1250,500,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ydkv73/guy_friend_m28_who_i_thought_was_sending_some/

You can tell a million excuses why but at the end of the day, you chose to say “yes” to a deal which isn’t benefitting you. It isn’t “evil women, they force me to be friends”, it’s “stupid me who chose to put myself in a shitty position”. If you’re okey with being only friends so don’t blame nobody for that.

265,Is it weird that I take every first date to Chili's?,"So I started this as a joke a couple years back because I liked Chili's and I unintentionally went on back-to-back first dates at Chili's (It's a good middle ground of not fast food but not super expensive). I realized and I thought it was kinda funny and so I decided to make it a tradition and take every 1st date to a Chili's (doesn't have to be the same one I've been to several)

I am convinced it's one of the best 1st date spots because having lunch or dinner with another person allows plenty of time to talk and get to know each other while also setting a time limit so someone can leave without making it awkward. I've also had girls ask to go get dessert somewhere else so there are plenty of ways to extend the date as well. 

This method also allows me to have a controlled environment where everything is the same but the girl I'm hanging out with. So I can compare how well the date went with all my other past Chili's dates. 

Plus if the date goes badly I still get to eat Chili's .
Is this brilliant or weird? 

Ps. This post is not sponsored by Chili's

Edit: people are saying to go to a local place, but I travel a lot and it would ruin the joke bc local places are... local. I wouldn't be able to do it every time and the thing that makes this funny to me is that it's EVERY 1st date.",vnnixn,1235,421,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vnnixn/is_it_weird_that_i_take_every_first_date_to_chilis/
266,Who would've thought liking chubby girls would make dating so difficult,"I've always loves curves. Actually that's an understatement, I honestly need some softness or I can't get fully aroused, and it's been that way for as long as I can remember.

Not curves like enormous fake asses and boobs but general chubbyness around the thighs, belly, back etc. The skinny fat or chubby look. 

Since I'm a fit guy I'll often have women commenting on their diet or mentioning working out or a willingness to lose weight in an effort to appeal to me, little do they know It's having the opposite effect.

Whenever I've told girls I love curves they take it the wrong way - they think I'm implying that they're out of shape, or that I'm fetishizing them or they think I'm lying, or they get all defensive and effectively say 'well I enjoy keeping fit so if you don't like that you can fuck off'

So what the fuck am I supposed to say when they tell me about how they plan to hit the gym more often or they're dieting or they lament their one roll of belly fat or something?

Social pressure has done such damage to them that they convince themselves they enjoy eating like a sparrow with a tasteless diet and working out every day (I know some people enjoy the challenge) and then when a guy comes along who admits that he loves curves, instead of breathing a sigh of relief that there are poeople like me out there, they seem to get defensive.

Guess what - yesterday a girl told me after a pretty short date that she (25F, 153cm) finds me unattractive because I'm too short (I'm 28M and 165cm) for her preference. I did not asked for any feedback from her side, and as most already said in the other comment, it indeed ruined at least yesterday for me. I mean I know already that I'm far from being the tallest, and that some women prefer for obvious reasons taller guys - so no reason to remind me about it! But yeah, no worries, I'm sure I'll get over it soon.

273,Coming up on 6 dates with guy - saw hinge notifications and that he’s been updating his profile. Feeling a bit hurt and losing interest bc he’s dating multiple people. Do I just have to accept this as the norm for online dating?,"Had six dates over the course of a month with guy and things are going really well. We both put a lot of effort into planning dates as well as communicating. We’ve been having sex side date 2 and even had some pretty intense/connected sleepovers - at times we’ve both been (good) speechless after making out or sex. His actions match his words as far as his interest level in me so I’m not concerned that he’s stringing me along. 

We are taking things slow and I’m personally not ready to commit, not because I want to see other people/options, but because I don’t feel like we know each other well enough after only meeting A few times to become official. Additionally I found out that he’s only a few months out of a 5 year relationship. 

Our next date coming up is something kind of expensive so I thought that was an indication of our intentions. 

I’ve seen hinge notifications his phone during dates and noticed a couple of times lately he’ll send me a nice picture from his day and then it will appear on his Hinge profile shortly after. This hurts my feelings and puts me off to spending more time with this guy. 

Just thinking that he has a few girls in rotation really stresses me out and does not make me feel like competing and rather makes me want to step back from him as a whole even though he’s a great guy. 

Do I just have to suck it up and deal with this as a part of online dating? Should I take a step back from him and create some distance?

Of course I was sad that the feelings weren’t reciprocated but I am more so proud of myself for having the guts to ask her out in the first place. Especially the fact that I asked her in person with other friends directly nearby

I was 90% sure she did not feel the same way about me before I asked her out but I’m so glad I took the chance anyway. The victory for me was the fact that I asked her out at all and the fact that she even said yes to one date was huge bonus points

Better to be rejected by the person than reject yourself by not asking them out in the first place",tkcc2h,1190,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tkcc2h/rejection_is_a_good_thing_it_means_youre_putting/

My only reservation is that he’s never dated anyone else besides me. It’s seems like things are moving into a long term relationship but i am feeling anxious and not sure how to go about this.

I was being stupid, running late and rushing when I switched lanes too quickly without fully checking and hit a car in the next lane. When I pulled over to exchange license and insurance info with the other driver out comes a cute guy with nice eyes. I was apologizing over and over for the accident and he was surprisingly chill about it, he was like “it’s okay, accidents happen”. We had to go to the police station to file a report because the damage was pretty considerable and he suggested we go to the police station together and so we did. After we finished talking to the officer, wrote our statements and all that, he left before I did and I walked out the door only to find him waiting outside. He was like “I just wanted to tell you I appreciate how you were willing to take accountability for a mistake, I respect that” he asked me if I was hurt (which I wasn’t) and then he started up a conversation, found out he was in grad school, new to my city. And then he asked me for my number and I don’t really know what came over me but I gave it to him lmao.

He texted me like 30 mins after, we’ve been texting back and forth and he wants to take me out lol. Should I give this guy a chance?

280,what's this girls problem?,I had a date with this Japanese girl last Saturday everything went great she was laughing at everything I was talking about she was also a great listener. We had sushi for lunch we slipt the bill since it was the first time meeting. Then we went the arcade which I paid for again she had lots of fun playing games with me. The final thing we did was we saw a movie together it was basically free because I had points for a two free tickets. Before we left I asked her if she would want to do this again and she said yes. So what I don't understand is I asked her for her number so we can continue our conversation off tinder but she was like I usually don't text message. So I asked her if she had snapchat or whatsapp ect. I basically got no response from that for about 24 hours so I continue to waited a few more hours. Still no response so I changed the topic and asked her how her day went still no response ok wtf? So then I waited a few more hours I asked her if she would wanted to meet on Saturday still no response ok it's been basically almost 30 hours now. I have the read feature on and basically she hasn't been reading any of the texts after asking if she has anything else to use for us to text. Why even agree to a second date if all your going to do is not even read my texts at all.

281,My date slept with someone else last Halloween night. Is it my fault because I left early?,"I've been dating a girl for about 2 months and things have been going really well. We were both initially at two different Halloween parties but she picked me up later and I continued at a party at her house. But it was already 3am, I had well already had something to drink and she was just getting started since she was a driver. But since I stood around there for an hour and only knew her there and ran after her, I quickly lost the mood and wanted to go already after an hour. I told her that and even though she asked why, it didn't seem like it was a big problem.
Now she wrote me that she felt like having sex, she was annoyed with me for leaving early and she spent the night with someone else. We never said what exactly it is between us and we never talked about a relationship between us. Still, I don't know how to deal with it right now.

Edit: I'm going to be completely honest. I didn't see our dates as something that would lead to anything serious. So now that she slept with someone else, the second I was gone, I now know that I will continue to date other girls and just see her as a FWB. Maybe one info I left out is that it won't be easy to completely ignore her, as she is also involved in another friend group that I am also a part of and we see each other a lot at parties.

284,I went on a date with myself and hated it (22M),"The week after my breakup I went on another date, probably too soon since the previous relationship made a love/hate connection between me and her (19F).

When the new girl (19F) came, she didn't catfish me but she looked more different than in her social media pictures but I was surprised. We talked and talked and smoked some funny cigarettes and when it hit me I had a breakthrough. Her mannerisms and jokes and just the way she carried herself were identical to my jokes style. Even though I am self-reflecting on myself a lot since I want to improve myself to be a person that other people want to be around (charismatic) I was senselessly shocked at how much I disliked her way of conversation. From seeing myself in her I noticed how many times I joke and tell something that seems funny to me. I noticed how insecure she was when I showed dislike and saw the same low confidence in my behaviour.

I took her to the train as that's doing the bare minimum and left. When heading home listened to music and thought about why I disliked it. If you would go on a date with yourself you would expect it to go fantastic? I thought so. Are the feelings I felt the same people feel when talking with my friends and relationship people? If I was repulsed by myself I should probably change my behaviour. My last girlfriend at breakup mentioned that sometimes she didn't get my jokes at all. If she looked just like the pictures would I not mind her behaviour?",ups3uq,1171,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ups3uq/i_went_on_a_date_with_myself_and_hated_it_22m/

I dont know what i did too deserve this. When i caught her she said its because i was a boring boyfriend and she ""deserved to fuck attractive guys"" (even though we didnt have sex cause i was waiting for her to ask). I thought i was being a good boyfriend too, I always texted her and asked her how her day went. I didnt try to solve her problems for her (i always said that sucks, or, im so sorry what do you want me to do to help). My financial situation is not the best so i learned to cook for her instead of taking her out for dates. Ive been working out and even though im not attractive im not ugly. I tried to make her laugh whenever i could. I dont know what to do and i feel like im dying, can someone please help explain what i can do better next time. I dont want to repeat any of my mistakes again.

Update: Thank you all so much for today. It turns out that tomorrow is Thanksgiving (in Canada) which i forgot about in my slump, and this might have potentially been my worst thanksgiving ever. But thanks to all of you that didnt happen and this turned out to be the most unique Thanksgiving ive ever had.

She was posting stories and on insta too and replying to her comments there but for me? Radio silence. 

She replied to my message today (Saturday night), which was 5 days later. I know I’m not entitled to her attention but I found it a little disrespectful. So I called it off. 

Here’s how the conversation went: 

Me: “Hey XXXXXX, do you want to get dinner somewhere next week? I know this place called XXXXXXXX near you!” 

Her: “Sure I’m free on wednesday is that okay?”

Me: “Yeah that’s fine! What time should we go? Can I come and pick you up at 5?”

SILENCE FOR 5 DAYS

Her: “sure
 how has your day been”

Me: “I made other plans. You took ages so I thought you weren’t up to it”

Her: “I mean I said yeah earlier but no biggie”

I didn’t respond. Did I do the right thing here? I don’t like it how she wasn’t considerate at all. If she needed time she could have said.

289,Dating less attractive people doesn't mean they'll treat you better,"A lot of men always tell women to just lower their standards and date someone less attractive. The theory behind this is very attractive men have the ability to treat women badly since they have so many options.

And a less attractive man will treat you better since his options are scarce.

I'm a male, and I decided to give this a try. I started to date women who are traditionally unattractive. Without a better way to word this, I went on quite a few dates with fugly women hoping to connect on personality, and I figured the worst that can happen is I'll get dating experience.

Some of these women were more ugly on the inside than they were on the outside. A lot of them treated me worse than super hot women did. A ton of ghosting, being stood up, being called names and so on. One woman acted like she was God's gift to the world and never paid for a single thing despite going out 4 times. She never said thank you either.

Another woman responded with ""lol"" when I asked her out on another date.  The first one appeared to go well at least.

So no, just because someone isn't attractive does not mean you'll be treated better. They can be as shitty as stuck up hot people.",wtb4np,1161,215,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wtb4np/dating_less_attractive_people_doesnt_mean_theyll/

300,Girls who prefer dating black guys,"So at work there’s this girl (22F) who I’ve (22M) talked to a few times. She’s very friendly and cool, plus she’s very cute. One of my co-workers who talks to her more often told me that she admitted to him that she “prefers chocolate” when it comes to men, and that she finds me very attractive. I would be so down, but the fact that she prefers black guys is a big red flag to me. I am usually wary of girls who say this, as it usually entails things along the lines of BBC fetishism, something I find problematic to say the very least. Besides the blatant racist undertones of this, it can be an even bigger problem for me because I don’t fit this stereotype at all. My dong is pretty average, and while I consider myself competent in the sack, this can disappoint women who expect me to pull out a 9 inch anaconda because the myth of all black men having equine endowments has become seen as a general fact by most of society due to porn and pop culture in general. Let me clarify that this woman is in fact white, and I’ve mostly been with non-white ladies. I’d love to try and pursue, but I don’t want it to end in embarrassment. So, these questions are for white women who purposefully seek out black men: does the expectation of a large penis play into your attraction? If not, then what is?

I am 25 years old and have been on many dates where this was not the case. American men are just different, that’s why I don’t date in America. No more Americans in Italy for me. 

Extra info add: He got a soda and water and they charge for both of those things here in Italy. No appetizers. His chicken was $25 the fries were $8 plus his drinks. And the salad was gross and I only ate half. Either way I was fine with paying for the shitty salad but there was no communication and he threw his card at the waiter quickly and said nothing.

The waiter asked cash or card and he had his card ready and handed it to the waiter and said nothing to me. I thanked him for the salad and he said you are welcome and we continued walking for hours while he never mentioned wanting money. We talked but no spark. It ended with him going in for a kiss but I gave him my cheek and he asked me to call him tomorrow because he would like to see me. I said okay. 

Plus I assumed he was nervous or something the way he was walking fast, but also making a lot of random conversation. It was only 5-10 minutes of this fast walking.",x7x97m,1091,503,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/x7x97m/first_date_splitting_the_bill_no_more_dates_for/

307,Rejection is part of the process,"I (29 F) dated a guy (35 M) I really liked. We dated for about 6 months. We've been broken up for nearly 3 months, now.

Things were great, and I was really falling for him. Until I said ""I love you."" Turns out, he didn't feel the same way. He ended things instead of leading me on. I respect him for it. I'm bummed, of course, because I thought we were very compatible and we liked each other a lot. He agreed with my assessment, but recognizes that he has personal work to do before he can get into a relationship. In the moment, I wasn't able to articulate my feelings about the breakup, so I wrote him a letter that I delivered a month later. I explained my own failings and offered to try again, to try and be better. Again, he declined. 

Does it hurt? Sure. Am I devastated? No. Disappointed? Definitely. But honestly, rejection is a part of dating. This person has now rejected me *twice,* and that's okay. He's under no obligation to date me, no matter how I feel. We communicated like adults, and I have the closest thing to closure that one can get. 

I also just asked out a former co-worker. He could reject me as well, and that's okay! It does suck and it'll hurt my feelings for a bit, but then I have to brush myself off and try again. 

Resilience is necessary and rejection is just part of the process. Giving up after rejection is only hurting yourself, and going through rejection and coming out the other side makes us better, stronger people.

308,Getting ghosted by a 6’3 girl has got me thinking,"I’m 6’5 and matched with a cute girl who also happens to be the tallest I’ve ever come across at 6’3 - of course we had height related banter and she joked that I just made her height cut off and our kid wouldn’t be able to ride roller coasters then we spoke about travel, music etc and I realised we had some unique interests in common so we made plans to hang out.

Anyway she’s left me on read for a few days before confirming the place - we were supposed to be meeting up this evening

Isn’t the first time this has happened (closer to the 100th time) but I’ve got to say the fact she’s 6’3 and only looking for guys 6’5 and above does make me sigh… because what are the chances she found someone that goddamn tall who she got on with better in the space of a few days? 

Probably pretty damn high considering how many guys there are on dating apps and how many guys lie about their height.

Either way this frustrated me more than the usual ghosting because I was so sure we were gonna meet up and have a nice time all things considered, I would have bet a kidney on it ( glad I didn’t) . Guess it shows how unpredictable the dating landscape is.

311,Was I Wrong to End Things With My Date? [Advice],"I'm 32 male, and she's 28 female. 

I met a woman on Bumble. I get a lot of matches, but for whatever reason, I hit it off with her. 

We took it slow, talked for a week, and met up. We had instant chemistry. After about three weeks, we've gone on four dates. We text multiple times a day.

She told me I'm way hotter than my photos, and she says I have the same values as her; she's emotionally and physically attracted to me. 

I asked her to be exclusive on the last date since things were going so well. She's not my girlfriend, but I want to date and see where things go. 

She got quiet and said she was still talking to two other guys. I was floored as I stopped talking to other women immediately after I hit it off with her. 

She said the other person and she hasn't met, but they have an excellent texting relationship. She says she's as attracted to them as I am, but that could change if they meet in person. 

I immediately ended things with her. I said if I were as wonderful as she claimed I was, she wouldn't feel the need to talk to other people. I said she probably finds the other person more physically attractive and hopes it works out with them.

She says that's not the case, and she said in her past, guys she's dated have been talking to other women in the early stages, and things just ended because they ghosted or she didn't click with them. 

I told her I wasn't interested in that and moved on. My mother says that's how dating is. You date different people at once to see who you click with and then choose the person you think is best for you.",yxtuj5,1075,808,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/yxtuj5/was_i_wrong_to_end_things_with_my_date_advice/
312,"As a guy, Is it normal to have to initiate everything with women","So I have notice that as a guy, I have to initiate every interaction I have with women. Like all the time. For example, I picked a woman up from my med school and gave her a ride to the party. I notice the entire time that I had to make small talk and she wasn't very talkative at all. It is only after I flirted a little bit and made jokes that she was relax. Granted this is a girl that I talk to everyday. 

Another example is a girl that I talk to at a bar. She hugged me 7 times while we had a pretty deep convo. Well the next day in school. She was very quiet around me but super talkative to everyone else. It's only after I ask her, how she was during did she talk. But even than it was more formal. 

I notice that women don't approach at all. They only talk when I say something to them. But it has to funny and witty or else they will reject my conversation. I don't think a girl in my class has ever said something to me first at all. It's been like this for 3 months in my med school. 

Idk if it's normal but it can be draining knowing that I have to do all the work. And the women don't even ask me questions. It's like I have entertained them or else.

315,Important Tip for guys from a Happily Married man.,"Don't ever settle for being settled for.

Don't be her second choice. Don't be his second choice either, for a gay brothers out there.

But realistically for all men you can, with some time and patience, find a partner who will see you as her first pick as a partner.

Even if that person has been in relationships before or even married. You will know if you are her second choice or she is settling for you. And if you are unsure, find a way to make sure.

I've been married 13 years and my wife is my first choice and I am hers, that level of desire and love has helped us stay strong through the worst of it. I hope all you guys out there find that too.


*EDIT* 

Gonna add this little example of what I mean, it's from a comment I made to someone else.

Enjoy my cartoonish example. Simple yet satisfying.

She looked interested and hinted at a second date. 

I can't help it but I honestly feel kind of emasculated. Coincidentally she's taller than me too. I'm 6' and she's a few inches taller without heels, but she wore them to the date making her quite noticeably tower over me. On top of that, she holds a higher paying position than me and we're both engineers at a prestigious corporation. I'm confused as to whether she expects something from me, though I can't see why a young woman would pay a 43M for sexual favours.

You don’t delay interactions. 
You don’t make excuses. 
And you certainly don’t ghost.

 I never did anything about what i felt about her because multiple people told me she had a boyfriend, yet she NEVER said a single word about him. About 2 months ago i started noticing some sparks from her but i didn't think of it that way because I didn't want to get my hopes crushed.

 About a month ago, my roommate was out of town and we were alone together and at some point i lied on the bed to play a game of a game on my phone with my before mentioned roommate and she lies next to me and puts her head on my chest and fell asleep like that. I didn't know what to do so when i finished with the game i stood up and covered her with a blanket so she can sleep there and i would go and sleep on the other bed. She than told me she now can't sleep because i moved her and i jokingly said if she wants me to lay there again with her. To my surprise she said yes. She laid on me all the same and hugged me. Same thing happened a couple more up until now. Also we watched shows together and there was some touching involved there, that's all you need to know.

Last night we went bit further but she told me she doesn't want to be my first time since that's some kind of responsibility, idk. Long story short, i finished her with my fingers and i had to masturbate in the toilet later. 

Than we talked about whats happening between us and she said she likes when I'm around and that she is basically into me but she doesn't want for us to be together because she will ""damage"" me as she apparently did someone else before.

323,You're worth it.,"You deserve that great relationship. You deserve to be happy. You deserve to spend your time with someone that respects you and treats you with respect and love.

However you'll meet that sweet person once you stop trying to be someone else. If you want to be free you need to be yourself. 

Self development is great but it should teach you to love yourself as you are right now. With your flaws and insecurities. 

Be authentic. That's sexy.

Learn to say ""No"" when you want to. Don't force yourself to please someone else because they're probably just as insecure as you are. 

Find your passions and give in to them. It's perfectly fine to talk for hours about robots, watches or even plants if that's your thing. Someone will enjoy listening to what you have to say and even share the same interests. But you can't meet them because you're spending most of your time trying to please every potential partner.

I get it, you don't want to be rejected. But you're only rejecting and hating yourself when you take two hours to find the ""perfect"" first message on Tinder. Stop being fake and be yourself. 

You'll never be loved by anyone if you spend all your time figuring out ways for them to like you. 

Most you single folks are so desperate to find that great relationship that you've forsaken yourself. You're tired of dating. Tired of being disapointed over and over again. You're thirsty for love. But that cup of yours is empty. You're not filling your own cup and you expect to find someone else that does. 

You wanna know why most people meet someone great when they stop caring? Because when you finally stop searching for someone, you realise that you have found yourself. 

Don't let anybody telling you that you're not worth it, even yourself. 

I love you. I hope everyone of you will find the right person for them. <3

Edit : This post is about realizing your own worth. You're free to keep believing that you're a victim of modern society and find many reasons why you haven't found love yet. You can't change your past but you can start deciding what you want to create from now on. This is not some wishful thinking, this is reality. If you want to be happy, you have to choose it. It's your responsability to think good things about yourself. To love yourself. 

You can be negative about yourself and hate who you are. But self-hate only leads to more hate either from within or from people you meet. It's not like ""Maybe If I tell myself and everyone how pathetic I am, someone will start loving me."" 

People treat you the way you're treating yourself. Don't like it ? Then stop being an asshole towards your own self and start being more compassionate. Start by giving yourself some room for making mistakes. Give yourself the possibility to be okay as you are, even if you could improve on this or that.

And why are you so desperate to find someone anyway ? Because you're lonely ? 

You have a terrible relationship with yourself. How do you expect to be in a great relationship when you can't even stand yourself ? Dating is not about finding someone. It's about finding yourself. Each relationship teaches you about yourself. 

You can change. You can do it. But it has to come from you. Ain't nobody coming to save you.",rj6l90,1059,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rj6l90/youre_worth_it/

326,How to tell a Andrew Tate stan I’m not interested,"I (29f) went on a second date yesterday with a guy (28m). When we first met, it was at a bar and we had a great time. So when he asked for a second date, I was happy to go. However, that all changed once we were out. 

On the date, he constantly kept quoting Andrew Tate and stating how women need to be submissive to their husbands. He also said he wants to be just like Andrew. This guy idolized Andrew Tate. He kept asking me questions about my dating history. He even got jealous when I mentioned I have a personal trainer who is a male. He took my picture without asking and sent it to his friends. I expressed I didn’t like that since he didn’t ask if it was okay. He claimed since we are on public property he can take a picture of whatever he wants. I told him I didn’t like that. He just shrugged it off and refused to delete it. He also flipped off the barista that served us our coffee at Starbucks and thought it was funny. (Honestly I should have left him there when he did that but I was his ride).

When I was talking about a wedding I have to go to in a couple of weeks, he asked who was getting married. I explained my best friend and her long time bf who have 3 children together were. They just wanted to make it official. The guy then asked what their roles were in the household and without thinking I told him the bf works while my best friend takes care of the kids and home. The guy I’m on a date with then applaud it and said that’s how it should be. He also talked about how my best friend needs to make sure she keeps her figure right to keep her man happy. I then asked what if the husband behaves poorly in the relationship (cheating, lying, etc)? Doesn’t she deserve happiness in the relationship too? He stated if the woman stays in her place, those issues will never happen. If the husband cheats, then there a reason for it. He told me I need to ask myself “what did she do wrong to make him cheat?”. 

At this point I was ready to take him back home. I made an excuse to end the date early and take him home. Later that day, he told me he liked me and wanted to see me more. I don’t know how to let him down without him possibly blowing up. He showed childish behavior too while on the date and I wouldn’t put it pass him if he try to be petty and act like an ass. I will be running into him again since my friend is dating his friend. Also we live in the same area so my chances of running into him again are pretty likely.

There was instant alchemy between us and it was probably the best first date I've had..to date, and it's left me feeling revitalised...much better than wallowing in my own slough of self pitying bullshit in my dingy little apartment.

I'm not suggesting that everyone force themselves to do things they'd rather not do all the time, but sometimes a little push can help create some positive momentum in life.

329,I think I might be a sugar daddy and I feel conflicted about it.,"
So just for some backstory I’m a pretty young guy (29) and recently have starting making more money after switching careers this year. Probably more than I deserve. Before this year, I was pretty poor, and could never afford the finer things in life. 

I’m just getting back into dating after being single for almost 8 months. I’ve been talking with this girl (26) and she’s going to school and is not doing well financially. She’s never outright said it, but I can tell she’s been really struggling. Like last week we went to the fair and I paid for the tickets and told her not to worry about it. And she was extremely thankful, just for that tiny thing. I felt really good doing that for her. Since we met like a month ago (besides our first date) we’ve always split things 50/50…and before anyone says anything that was her idea, not mine.

Anyways a few days ago we were talking on the phone and she was telling me about how she barely had any food left and has been eating ramen all week. She didn’t say it in a whoa is me type of way either, she sort of just said it casually and moved on. So I told her I can take her grocery shopping. I let her pick out anything she wanted. She was so emotional and extremely grateful. Anyways as this was happening I realized I was getting turned on from helping her. And the thought of giving her money and helping her out again was turning me on. I’ve never had this happen before. 

The day after that she asked me if I could give her a couple bucks for gas so she can go to class and she would pay me back. I did that for her and told her not to worry about paying me back. She was very grateful and basically almost cried. 

Then today she texted me and asked me to help her with her phone bill and that it was going to get cut off the next day if she didn’t pay it. I don’t know if she was telling the truth but I obviously helped her.  

I don’t want to become her sugar daddy and just have her be with me because I buy her things, but I also get really turned on doing stuff like that for her. I need to find that balance. 

I need to know if this is sustainable long term if we become more serious.

Now I'm a 21st century man who believes equal rights in majority aspects, but I know when it comes to dating and relationships it's still a battle of the sexes in some regards. And while I was intruiged, I felt it was unfair to ask someone you approached for a drink. And that had her leaving me insulting me on the way out.

337,2 guys invited me on a date to the same concert,"So I'm in a pickle. A guy said he was going to this concert with his grandfather, but his grandfather got hurt and can't go. So he asked me if I want to go with him to the concert. I said yes.

Then a few hours later, a different guy asked me out on a date...to the same concert. I said I was already going with a friend and he told me he'd like to meet up with me while we're there, say hi and such (we've only been talking on a dating app and haven't met in person yet).

I definitely don't want to say hello to the second guy when I'm on a date with the first guy, but I have no idea what to say to guy #2 in order to avoid meeting him.

I don't want to lie to him. I'd definitely rather say I'm going on a date than make up an excuse not to meet him. But if there's a third option, one where I can say no without lying AND without telling him I'm going on a date, I'd choose that one.

Is that even possible here?

Edit: Some of the replies are pretty funny! And some of you are legit concerned (for the guys) and I do appreciate that.   
To answer some questions:  
\- Guy #1 is my actual friend (with benefits). Not lying about that (though I admit it was still shady to introduce him as my friend rather than my date)

\- I met up with Guy #2 last night and told him that I've been going on dates with other guys (because he asked), though I did not clarify that the concert thing was going to be date too.

I met this girl on Bumble and dated her for 3 months. We got along very well and talked for hours. I could feel that we really had a connection. However, I noticed that she was still using Bumble. Then all of a sudden she lost interest in me. I don't get it. Yesterday I felt so empty. I actually thought I found someone for a relationship. Stupid me. 

I don't believe in this dating apps anymore. People are always looking for better options. Like are we on a freaking bazaar?! I think these people will never find someone because they always believe that they can find someone better. They are always chasing for a better opportunity. I am done with that. 

I went to the gym this morning and reflected. After I got back home deleted the apps.

From now on it will be only self growth. I don't care if I will stay single. I won't be actively looking for a relationship anymore. Maybe it will happen - maybe not. But I won't waste my time for that shit no longer.

So at this gala, he only introduced me to people as his “date”, or just said my name.  I’m a little bummed bc it feels like he’s my bf, but apparently he doesn’t think so?

Guys - do you think he still likes me and sees potential with me? How should I bring up the topic of labels to him?

356,"If you want a real relationship, you should stop giving ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" benefits without requiring a commitment.","The title might get misinterpreted, so I want to explain.

Let's say you make cookies for a bake sale, and you really want $2 per cookie. You want potential customers to know how great your cookies are, but instead of putting out small ""samples size"" bites and then marking your cookies with a ""$2"" price tag, you instead just make the cookies free and have an optional tip jar.

What happens then is, most people just stop by, thank you, and take your cookies for free. Some of them might tip, but the majority do not. Before you know it, all of your cookies are gone and you barely made any profit. 

You begin to doubt yourself: **""What's wrong with my cookies? Why are my cookies not good enough for others to pay for?""**

Meanwhile, the person next to you sold all of their cookies, and made a great profit. *Why them, and not you?* 

**The truth often times, is simply: that the other person had clear expectations of the price they were requiring.**

This doesn't mean that there's not people who might *still* try to steal a cookie when their back is turned. Some might even be successful. But the boundaries are set, and the majority of people will either decide the cookie is worth paying for or leave. 

* How does this apply to modern dating (if y'all haven't already figured it out)? 

The ""relationship benefits"" is the cookie. Some of y'all will give a person everything they'd get if they were in a relationship with you... without being in a relationship with you. Sex, affection, time, dates, money, attention, etc. 

You're thinking the ""right person"" will naturally want to commit regardless, but by giving all the benefits away so freely, you're 1) inviting people into your life who don't consider commitment with you worth it, but will ""enjoy the ride"" because you aren't requiring it and 2) making it harder to see the people who would actually commit, because you're wasting your time on people who won't. 

Of course, dating is supposed to be fun and you need to market yourself as a great potential prospect. The person you're dating should get a ""sample"" of all the wonderful benefits of dating you.

(Edit to add: please note when I'm referring to ""relationship benefits,"" I'm NOT just talking about sex. I'm not holding any sort of value judgment against anyone who wants to have sex early on. I don't think having sex decreases your value. 

My only point was that many people will stick around and lead you on, if they're getting all the relationship benefits front-loaded to them.

357,What I learned from shooting my shot as a woman,"Hi guys, first of all I’m thankful for having received many advices in this sub. As you can see in my last posts, I’ve been having troubles with dating and last week I asked my crush to come over but in an ambiguous way (I’m the girl who asked her crush to come over to meet her dog hahahah). Many of you suggested I had to be more direct because you guys are oblivious catching women’s signs. So yesterday I finally texted him to ask him on a date. As the shy girl I’ve always been, I was very nervous sending that text (now I understand how you feel every time you ask a woman on a date lol). It took me a lot of courage but I did. He didn’t reply at all, he left me on read some hours ago. So I’m assuming he’s definitely not interested/attracted to me. At least I hadn’t brought my hopes that up and was expecting a kind of sweet rejection. He’s still a great guy though and I don’t blame him, but I would have at least expected a honest response.

What I learn from shooting my shot: if you never try you’ll never know. Honestly I would rather get rejected that remain wondering “what if”. At least now I can move on. 💪",vfov5m,967,182,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vfov5m/what_i_learned_from_shooting_my_shot_as_a_woman/

I’m a quiet person and haven’t dated in awhile. I’ve thought maybe I should smoke a little before I show up so that I’m less nervous.

359,clubbing alone,"I just got out of a toxic 5 year relationship (that of wish I have a four year old son with) with my now ex. I figured I should go out and meet women so I took after clubs and bars. Since I had no friends I decided to just go alone and it was the best experience ever. The first time I went out I just drank had a good time and actually hooked up with a pretty girl. This week I didn't have any luck but I met a lot of cool dudes that would like to hang out and go bar/club hopping in the future. I refuse to let my past relationship bring me down but I have had success just going out alone and meeting new people.

361,"I’m tired of “dating down”, but are my expectations unreasonable?","Let me preface this by saying I don’t really like the term “dating down” because I don’t really believe that anybody is lesser or greater, or more or less deserving. I just had to boil it down succinctly for the title of my post. 

What I really mean is that I’m tired of not feeling as if the women I date bring comparable levels of value to the table within the context of a relationship. 

I’m a young professional that makes a lot of money, is above average in looks(this may sound narcissistic, but I’m just attempting to paint a picture here. I used to model as a datapoint), has plenty of hobbies and interests outside of work, loves to cook and clean, and as a partner I’ve been consistently told I’m emotionally attentive, caring and a good listener. I’ve also historically taught / introduced the women I’ve been with to a lot of new ideas, activities, etc. 

I feel as if the women I’ve mostly had the opportunity to date only bring a fraction of these things to the table, and often times don’t challenge me intellectually. 

This feeling of asymmetry while dating has been increasingly frustrating for me on a personal level. I don’t feel as if it’s too much to ask to find someone that’s attractive (to me), intellectually stimulating, emotionally mature, has a good career, and plenty of interests / hobbies… the flip side is that I’m wondering if I’m asking for too much and should temper my expectations? 

Perhaps a potential partner doesn’t need to check every box, and I need to decide what’s most important to me? And then I can get the things I’m missing from my relationship from outside sources (I.e, sharing in or learning new things and hobbies with friends). 

I’ve mentioned this to friends and they’ve suggested I should try and grow with someone, which is great and all, but this requires a large time investment, and as I get older I’m aware that I, 1. Have less time and 2. Don’t want an almost paternal relationship with my partner where I’m the primary source of their growth. 

Would be curious to hear other people’s thoughts. 

Also worth noting that I’m in no way saying I’m perfect. Everybody has developmental points and is constantly growing (at least ideally from my perspective).",ycgyqb,957,677,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ycgyqb/im_tired_of_dating_down_but_are_my_expectations/

367,"Would you settle for your 85% match, knowing that your 100% is out there somewhere?","I watched a movie recently (can’t remember the title) where a character says something along the lines of:

“You’ve found your 85%. That’s pretty good, but it also means your 100% person is still out there”. 

Finding someone who’s your 85% is pretty darn great! But knowing that there is maybe someone out there who is your 100% could cause you to question if you’re settling with that 85%. But who knows if you’ll ever cross paths with the 100%. 

Obviously we don’t have % floating above our heads but still….Is it worth accepting that 85%, or holding out for the 100%?

Edit: lots of comments! It’s cool to hear everybody’s unique perspective on this! I understand no one will ever be 100% perfect, including myself and everyone in this thread. Rather, I interpret the “85%” to mean that 85% of the relationship is smooth and fun and enjoyable for both parties! The remaining 15% consists of the inevitable hurdles/roadblocks that come in a relationship. So long as the 85% makes both partners feel fulfilled, then navigating the other 15% through compromise and patience will  hopefully be worth the effort! Who knows, maybe it could eventually turn into 100%

EDIT #2: I just remembered! This idea was from a book called “One Day in December” by Josie Silver…the quote goes “I'm trying to work out if people need to start out at one hundred percent or if they can start at, I don't know, seventy, and work their way up.”

370,Things I’ve learned / done to get successfully get more dates.,"I didn’t start dating people until I was like 25. Didn’t start being sexually active until last year. I’m in my late 20s. This is what I’ve found helps me out a bunch. Male btw

1. My best quality dates have been from dating apps. So I’ll mostly talk about that here, if you want my thoughts about that ask me in the comments.

2. Don’t stop talking to people just because you’ve gone on a single date with someone else. This was the hardest one for me honestly. It feels like you’re cheating almost, but you’re not. Most of your first dates will not work out, don’t stop talking to people until you’re actually seriously seeing someone. Guarantee most are doing the same to you.

3. No selfies in your pictures 

4. Don’t mess with the small talk. Ask for their number as soon as whatever conversation you were having ends. For me, I do this when I feel the urge to switch topics in conversation. Works pretty well.

5. Occasionally open dating apps and swipe once or twice during the day. Dating apps tend to only show you if you’re online, if you’re online more you get shown more. 

6. Another big one that was difficult for me, enjoy the dates for what they are. Don’t think of them as investments that only pay off if you continue seeing them. Learn to enjoy meeting new people even if that is the last date you have with them. Leads me to the next point….

7. Go on date often. Easier said than done, but I do find that a lot of people get overwhelmed going on dates. You have to learn to enjoy dates. I see this sub and it’s a bunch of anxiety ridden people who get overwhelmed if they go on two dates a month. Learn to get over that. I didn’t start going on dates regularly until I enjoyed going on them. I think a lot of people here will be surprised just how much actually enjoying going on dates helps, instead of dreading the date but doing it anyways because you want the relationship.

8. Dress nice. Especially in your pictures. Learn to enjoy wearing nice clothes.

9. Clean your house often. This will give you confidence when going on dates, because you’re not scared to bring them back. Always have a clean house before going on a date. 

10. Have hobbies. Be passionate about something.

11. Don’t be a slob. Workout at least once a week. No one wants to date a slob, or at least the majority of people don’t. 

12. You’re not unattractive. Don’t hide your features in your profile. Yeah there are definitely unattractive people out there, but if you dress nice and workout once a week at least that won’t be you. 

13. Be confident. Easier said than done, but you’re an adult. Learn how to love yourself. 

14. Listen to the other person. You should be asking more questions to get to know them than you talking about yourself.

15. Learn to cook. 

16. Go on picnics 

17. Go on hikes

18. Clean your car

19. If you’re not getting matches, it’s not you it’s your profile. Go to r/tinder or whatever and post your photos / bio, and take the advice they give in stride. Don’t ask your friends for advice, they know you. You want people who don’t know you to give their impressions. 

20. Ask them out on a date immediately after you get their number

Edit: so I mentioned r/tinder but I almost never actually use it. Bumble and hinge for me, just linked it because the sub usually talks about all dating apps.

Second edit: lots of butthurt dudes who are mad at the world are clearly just downvoting any new comments. If a post on Reddit giving advice is getting you so heated, then the reason you’re not getting dates is because you have anger issues you have to deal with",rqxnur,941,308,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rqxnur/things_ive_learned_done_to_get_successfully_get/

372,"Guys, women appreciate a guy who can make decisions.","I think I live in a city where the men are particularly indecisive. I hear women complain about this. If you are making plans come up with a good suggestion and see if they like it instead of saying ""I don't know what do you want to do?""

Your goal here should be to reduce the amount of friction that she has to encounter to meet up with you. Online dating is laborious for women and you want to reduce that as much as possible.

This is what I do for a first date:

1. Does she like cocktails or should it be coffee/froyo? Make sure you're not asking someone who is a former alcoholic out for a drink at a bar 😬

1. Ask what part of town she lives in

1. Find a cool bar between the two of you. If you really want to make it easy for her make it in her neighborhood. If you feel like she has low interest then you can make some points by making it really easy for her to get to the meet. **Not a loud bar** unless it's a sports bar and you two want to go and watch the game together.

1. Get a rough idea of time: ""after dinner on Thursday?""

1. ""Ok how about 7PM Thursday at Acme Bar? it's in Dorchester""

1. Done.

Don't @ me about how drink dates are basic or whatever. My goal with a first date is to get to know her well enough to decide if I want to have a second date and what we might do on that second date. It's hard to get to know someone at a movie and a hike is too much time commitment. Since it's getting to be summer coffee in the park is a good second choice.",unik5r,926,447,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/unik5r/guys_women_appreciate_a_guy_who_can_make_decisions/

I’m not exactly sure who is wrong here. Probably both of us. One of the guys I have sex with pretty regularly came over a couple days ago.

I said something while we were on a little recovery break that implied he wasn’t the first guy I had sex with that day (which was true I had sex with a different guy earlier that day). 

I thought I was being sexy/naughty because he thinks it’s hott to call me dirty names and stuff in bed. Anyway, he was pretty upset. He said he could feel that I had been used early that day and I want as fresh as normal. He said some other hurtful stuff too.

I’m just wondering is it my responsibility to tell him this? 

I’ve always been under the impression that fwb can have sex with whoever they like and don’t need to talk about it with eachother.

374,How to ask GF who was raped to get tested?,"Me (m26) and my girl (26f) have been dating for a month or two now and we have been pretty intimate. She is natively from the Caribbean and is one of the most beautiful people you'll ever see. I care deeply for her and it's easy to see that she is also crazy for me as well.

She has been opening up to me a lot recently and has now told me about how she was raped multiple times in her home country... And I don't even mean by a partner or something; It was by strangers that took her when she was younger, let's say mid to late teens—Which broke my heart to learn. This was not the only time but that's all I'll mention here. 

It killed her to even tell me this, because she thought I would leave her (I don't know why she thought this), but she kept hinting at it and I eventually got it out of her.

When I expressed to her that I don't feel any differently about her because of it and that I still love her just the same, her intimacy turned up to 11.. I love this girl. 

One way or another I'm trying to be sensitive and because I know it's a hard topic for her I don't want to bring it up anymore. I also don't want her to feel like I see her any differently because of it.. And I don't want her to feel like I am backtracking on the reassurances I gave her before........ But at the same time I feel like I could be putting my own health at risk. 

We haven't had sex, and because of our religion hopefully that's something we can keep from happening for the time being.. But there is no telling because we get pretty intimate and things start happening so I don't know how long we can hold out. Last night we almost crossed that line but I stopped it which was difficult to say the least. 

Edit: spelling 

Edit 2: I want to be clear, I didn't stop it because of the reason for this post, I did because we both agreed prior that we didn't want to have sex yet and I know this is something she believes strongly in sex after marriage and she would regret it later even if she felt it in the moment. This is something she believes more than even I do and I feel like I would be taking advantage of her if I used the intensity of the moment to blow past barriers we agreed on when level headed. 

Edit 3: so do you guys think I should even ask, or just go with it and what happens happens?—the thought of possibly getting something does terrify me, but the thought of betraying her trust in me also terrifies me.

She was this shy sweet girl but never struck me as religious and wanting to wait for it. We went on a few dates and she went hot and heavy on the making out early, so I assumed we would eventually get to the (sex). We did some stuff with our hands, and thats as far as we got. 

I dont really prioritize having sex in a relationship if I connect with them on an emotional level like I do with this girl, but there has to be at least a light at the end of the tunnel.

So as we were cuddling and getting into it the other day she drops a bomb on me, saying that she was thinking about us and about how she wants to save herself for marriage.

I just said it was fine and I understand that its totally up to her, but that i dont know if I could wait, especially because theres no guarantees ill marry this girl (different life paths).

382,Does massage mean “sex”?,"I was on a date with a guy we were having dinner. He was discussing how much pain he was in with his back. I jokingly said I give great massages. He asked for one, and the conversation was going well, so I decided to say sure I’ll give you a massage. Went back to my place started giving a massage and all of a sudden he takes off his pants. As I was giving him a massage he kept trying to take my hands around to his front side. He kept on saying just touch it just touch it just touch it, I kept saying no. I actually said no four times and he ended up putting his penis in my hands and jacking off. And then asked him to leave.

383,I like this guy that's 35.,"Hi, this is my first post ever. I (19f) just started a new job as a baker, and there's a guy that I think is hot/handsome. The only problem is he's 35 and  I don't know what I should do, just the thought of talking to him makes me nervous and I can't breathe. So talking to him about how I feel is not a real option for me. I'm sorry I don't know what much to say, but I could really use some help. Should I just say 'Fuck it' and try to talk to him when we are alone or should I just leave it alone?

Please help. Thank you!

384,Do NOT Confess!,"One common post I see repeatedly, here and other advice subs is along the lines of

You can't, unless you've mastered the art of putting toothpaste back into the tube, then you *might* have a chance. But you probably don't have a chance.

If you're debating on whether or not to **confess** your feelings towards your crush…

# DON'T

Ask them out on a date instead. 

See, asking your crush to go on a date is a simple proposition. It says ""*I like you, and I want to pursue you romantically*""

385,Would you date someone who’s asexual?,"I’m asexual. I’m open to having sex with someone once we’re in a relationship but it’s purely performative from my side. I like to see my partner enjoy himself but that’s it. I could be doing dishes for all I care. Obviously this is a problem for a lot of people and I’ve had a hard time dating. Would you date someone like me?

EDIT: I’d like to thank everyone who has offered advice, words of encouragement, personal experience or happy stories of people who are also asexual 😀 I really appreciate it. It’s amazing and gives me a lot of hope. 

If you wouldn’t date an asexual person then please don’t insult me or try to make me feel less-than. I’m as I am. We’re incompatible and that’s okay. But to the people who respectfully explained why they wouldn’t - thank you for letting me see the other side of the coin.

386,"If you knew how they speak of you behind your back, you'd get over them REAL fast","People are incredibly two-faced when it comes to dating. I don't know if it's always been like this, or if it really is specific to the 21st century, but trying to love someone in this day and age is absolute cancer. I've personally given up on it for the time being to reinvent myself, but it's no wonder why so many turn to strategies or play games: they're just returning the favor. Hurt people hurt people, but at some point, the cycle is gonna have to end. Will you lend a hand?

&#x200B;

I went out for drinks with acquaintances last evening. At some point, this girl pops out her phone, and shows around a DM convo with a guy she matched on Tinder with to ridicule him in front of all of us. His crime? He double-texted her (to correct a typo mind you) and had a (sort of) cringey pic of him riding the subway on his profile. That's it. They then started discussing what the best way to get rid of him would be: leaving him on read permanently, bullshitting him that she wasn't over her ex, giving him the classic 'it's not me it's you' line... merrily giggling all throughout.

&#x200B;

Now. I could give a shit about this guy. Never met him, never will. But he wasn't being inappropriate, rude, or clingy. He was just shooting his shot, probably scratching his head as to why she went from showing interest to ghosting him in less than 24 hours.

&#x200B;

And then it hit me, like a bowling ball at 300 mph.

&#x200B;

I've been that guy. Many times. Offering to reschedule a date TWICE because she pretented to 'really want to go' but was 'busy'. Inviting a girl out after she ghosted me and came back hat in hand, only to ghost me AGAIN. Asking my ex to get back together when she had been plotting her escape plan behind my back months prior to dumping me. Seeing the other side's perspective before my very eyes, and picturing all those girls making fun of me in the same way was pretty sobering.

&#x200B;

You often read that the antidote to flakiness is lowering your standards. If you're in a relationship with a person beneath you, they'll be so happy to be with you that they won't pull any of that shit. Makes sense right? Nope. Quite the opposite is true in fact. You will end up resenting the person you settled for, and they'll resent you in turn. Congratulations: you just wasted 3-5 years of both your lives, and are now more miserable than before! What you should do instead, is **becoming the type of person that makes others act right**. The guy/gal that makes you go 'Hell, I need to get my shit together this instant or I'm never going to hear from them again'.

&#x200B;

It's one thing to fake it till you make it, but at some point, you really do need to make it, and make it big. Then, you won't have to deal with any of that shit. Even if you do by accident, you'll just shrug it off, because you truly do know your worth. Not in a fake self-affirmation kind of way, where deep down, you're only fooling yourself and know that they aren't really missing out on anything stellar. Make it your life goal that the next time someone rejects you, dumps you, ghosts you, your answer be... amusement. How could they be so thick as to pass up on such a sweet deal? And then, forget about them forever. Because from now on, you will only deal with like-minded people who are as happy to be around you as you are to be around them.

&#x200B;

And with that, I'm off to the gym. Take care folks. Don't settle for less than what you're worth, but cultivate that worth in every way imaginable until the day you die.

387,Confident dorky boys are the best breed of man,"Ones who know they are dorks, and aren't ashamed of it. They get fully into their interests, talk about them with passion, and become skilled or knowledgeable about that interest. Thats all hot af, even if it's an interest you don't share. My guy is really good at geography, which is a subject I couldn't give less of a toss about, but still find very attractive when he knows stuff.

They also make you feel especially comfortable, because you know they won't judge you for your interests. Feeling comfortable around a guy is again, very attractive. 

What I'm saying here is basically, don't try to be someone you aren't. You won't pull it off, you'll end up seeming boring at best, or fake at worst. Lean into your niche and be proud of who you are, because plenty of girls absolutely love your type. Most of my friends are dorky dudes, and many of them have smoking hot girlfriends, not because they themselves are especially physically attractive, but because they are open about their love of silly things, and that makes them fun to be around.

I know it can be hard to gain confidence, but the first step is accepting that you are not and never will be the cool kid on the playground. And that's okay, because who you are is even better to a lot of ladies. Attraction is not just about looks for women. It's also about feelings, and making a woman feel safe and excited about things is something you can do better than any jock type out there.",y15pv8,885,189,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/y15pv8/confident_dorky_boys_are_the_best_breed_of_man/

i feel as i’m a good partner. i listen, i talk, i am affectionate, i spend a lot of time with them, and pretty much do everything with them. when i like someone, i am ALL into them. so i treat talking stages as relationships with no label. but then after a few weeks or so and i fully believe it’s going to turn into a relationship and i’m super happy they just stop talking to me or hit me with the “i’m not ready for a relationship” even though i was basically a girlfriend for a bit. 

or if i start talking to a guy, they lead on like wanting a relationship then once we go on a date(watching a movie at their place) and fuck, i’m just almost to nothing to them after the fact. also, i have tried the no sex on the first date trials, same results.

UPDATE:

Thanks for the advice and sharing your opinions. I decided to cut contact and not proceed forwards with dating her. I messaged her asking the reason for being up til 6am and she advised that she stayed up all night with friends as one of her mates was flying out at 5am that morning. I did not respond to this

She kept saying “I went to bed at 6am… fuck me!!” And issued no proper apology. I found it to be irresponsible on her end, as she could’ve easily messaged me that she was having a late night and that we needed to reschedule.

If you are in a relationship, don't cheat. Period. There is no excuse for it. There is no reason for it. If your going to cheat end the relationship. It's better to be single and alone than to be a backstabbing betrayer.

Even if your in a abusive relationship, there are many ways to escape that other than cheating. Legal ways as well to prevent further abuse. Don't cheat it will just make things worse.

Your children are involved in your relationship,.be a good example to your children. They see everything you do.

He has 3 younger sisters, so i’m guessing he was raised right with respect, but at some point i want him to make some moves lol! I am nervous because i have never had to be the one in “control”, normally it’s me saying no.

Note: To add, i normally can read the room. He however will keep the conversation flowing, never dry, always asking personal questions, always complimenting me.

Do people agree with me that there’s something very creepy about lying to someone and manipulating them to want to have sex with you by making them think you’re not gonna leave them straight away after, but then leaving? I genuinely would not have had sex with him if I knew it was just a hookup since I don’t like the idea of using someone for those reasons.There’s apps for hooking up and people who want no strings attached, why go through all the effort of manipulating someone who wants something deeper when there’s plenty of others who don’t? The guy I’m talking about approached me in college, complimented me, slid in my dms, asked me on a date, initiated the first kiss and initiated continuing talking just to completely ignore and ghost me and now I’m feeling empty.

412,Guy I was dating for 2 years broke up with me because I had BV that he gave me from cheating on me,"I (21F) was in a relationship with a guy(31M) for 2 years and things were going well. From my understanding, we were only sleeping with each other so we didn’t use condoms. At Year 2 of our relationship, I got BV for the first time. I took the antibiotics and things were back to normal. However, while I did have it, during intercourse he would breathe outwardly to avoid the smell or open all windows and run to the shower right after. He made me so insecure about it. We didn’t talk about it much except I started changing my diet, eating Kefir, taking probiotic pills etc. All of these efforts were pointless. He said he felt dirty after sleeping with me and needed confirmation that this was not an STI. I saw my doctor, got tested and they kept telling me everything was ok, but it was never enough for him. 

After our first argument, he said he needed time to think. After the month of him thinking about his feelings, we finally talk and he said he didn’t know if he was still interested in marriage and if he could continue dealing with my BV. And I told him that this was his way of avoiding taking responsibility for his actions in our argument. I gave him his space so we could discuss the argument and instead he used the time to break up with me….

Anyways, he concluded that he wanted to keep trying to make the relationship work and no lie, 2 days later I got a message from a girl on FB saying she’d been dating him for months… I couldn’t believe it. So I followed my gut and I messaged another girl I saw him add on FB during the one month he needed to cool off. I asked her how she knew him and she said they’d also been dating for 3 months. I sent him a screenshot of the messages and told him I didn’t know him and never wanted to speak to him again. Funny enough he said okay then deleted and blocked me. 

My BV was gone after we broke up and I am convinced it was because he was sleeping with other women without a condom and throwing off my PH level.

All in all, don’t be in a relationship with a boyfriend who:
1. Needs more than a day or week of NO CONTACT to get over an argument especially if he played a part in the conflict.
2. You can confirm has lied to you.
3. Makes you feel alone when your going through a health challenge

(Edited to include paragraphs)

Update!!
- To clarify we were officially exclusive after 1 month of dating. He said he loved me as he was asking me to be his gf.

Update 2!!

413,"Men, would you date an autistic woman?","Would you date an autistic girl?

Hello men of Reddit. I have a close friend (23F) who is convinced that she won't ever find anyone because she is autistic. I want to prove her wrong, at least give her confidence. 

First some info about her appearance. My friend wears glasses, has medium length wavy brown hair, green eyes, a cute nose, and a thick booty. She's shortish. 

She is on the autism spectrum. She loves to be hugged and squished, is overwhelmed by social interaction, and has many special interests that she could go on for hours about. She embraces this part of herself and is open about it. She finds it hard to read peoples emotions and needs people to say what they mean in order for her to understand. She doesn't believe that the men around her are interested because she has no hard evidence to think so. I think it's just because she doesn't pick up on their ques. 

She writes, makes pixel art, plays video games (Pokemon, Lego video games, Skyrim, league of legends where she mains tanks, and Zelda games), plays DnD, watches her favorite movies and TV (star wars, LOTR mostly) on repeat. She gardens, builds and collects Legos, recently took up cooking, and is a loving aunt and sister. She is about to graduate college. 

She has anxiety, and struggles with depression, but she is the most supportive person a friend could ask for. She is everyone's personal cheerleader. She has endless compassion and enthusiasm. 

So, men, is this a type of person you would be interested in dating? Any other autistic women that have advice? Honesty is appreciated either way. Thanks!

update: thanks to those responding! I'm trying to respond to as many as I can but there's just so many. this went better than I could've imagined haha

update 2: thank you all for your responses! I'm just floored by the interaction and positivity. I showed my friend and she is overwhelmed in a good way. it was really helpful for her to see a quantifiable number of people saying yes. thank you for the advice and the personal experiences and most of all for the honesty. you did good today Reddit. :)",xwdr7q,844,573,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xwdr7q/men_would_you_date_an_autistic_woman/
414,'I'm busy' with no counter offer should be interpreted as a rejection every time,"A couple of nights ago I \[26M\] was chatting to a girl at a party, and we seemed to be vibing. Not out of this world, but enough that I decided to get her WhatsApp and message her the next day asking her out for a drink the following week. Her response was: 

'Hi \[my name\]! Hmm, actually I am quite busy this week :( '

That was it. No 'I would love to, but...', and no counter offer of a different time. 

I always interpret this as a rejection - and quite an obvious one - but I was curious to know how other people interpret this kind of response, so I read some threads on the Internet. I was surprised by how many people were saying things like 'Some girls might just genuinely be really busy and not necessarily intend that kind of message to be a rejection.' 'Follow up one more time and if she gives you nothing the second time, move on.'

I think this is very poor advice, for a very simple reason: if you ask a girl on a date and she is not interested, she will almost never say 'no', because of social etiquette and even safety concerns. Most of the time, to soften the blow, she will instead give an excuse about why she can't go on the date, and then won't propose any alternative. And here is the key point: this is not merely **a** technique of rejection, but **the** technique. It is the most socially acceptable and low-cost way of communicating rejection when no other excuse is available (e.g. 'Sorry, I have a boyfriend').

Because 'I'm busy' with no counter offer is the go-to rejection technique, the vast majority of girls who send a message in that format intend it as such, and the small minority of girls who don't should not be surprised or disappointed if the guy doesn't follow up again. When a particular response format carries such a widely agreed-upon (and entirely logical) subtext, it makes no sense to use it to convey any other meaning. Instead, if a girl is genuinely busy but still interested in going on a date with the guy, she will propose another time, and just generally express enthusiasm about the idea.

In my own experience, if I get an initial 'I'm busy' response with no counter offer, 100% of the time I will either not hear from her again, or not hear anything positive on a follow up (rare, since I don't follow up anymore). While some people claim that following up works a small percentage of the time, I don't see the point in making 98% of girls double down on a rejection just to finesse something with the 2% who don't have a grasp of social subtext.

Take the message as the rejection it nearly always is, and move on.",v5zf6a,844,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v5zf6a/im_busy_with_no_counter_offer_should_be/
415,"Great guy I started seeing is inexperienced in sex/flirting and that makes it uncomfortable to start anything sexual, help","I’ve just met this great guy from a dating app and thought he was very handsome. We went on a first date at a live music bar and had a great time.

He said to me that his only relationship (which lasted only a couple months) was 5 years ago and that he had sex only once with the same girl. She then broke his heart and he hasn’t been with anyone else since. 

I was a little skeptical at first but everything checks out: he acts very shy, has a hard time making a move, doesn’t flirt very well 

I’m willing to put an effort into this because he is a great guy otherwise. He is honest, we have a lot of fun and etc. Doesn’t seem like a “player” to me. 

However whenever we are together, his behavior makes me a bit shy too, and I can’t seem to find a moment to be more intimate, kissing or touching, even though I am attracted to him. We only kissed once at the bar. He even slept in my bed a few days ago, but nothing sexual happened.

419,"I (22f) am having the ""porn discussion"" with a guy (24m) I am interested and I need to know if the ensuing conversation is a red flag.","Currently I am having a conversation with a dude that I WAS contemplating getting with, but suddenly our conversation is making me unsure. I hate to have my thoughts on this person changed because of a simple principle, so I'm asking the general consensus what they think.

I, personally, don't care if the guy I'm dating watches porn. I don't want him to be like obsessed but it's not unhealthy in my opinion. Now, some girls feel very differently and I can't blame them, I think it depends what you're comfortable with and your partner should respect that. 

I feel like every guy I talk to about it has the same opinion and I'm sick of hearing that it's impossible not to watch porn. The convo started because he told me a story of his coworker getting dumped by his gf cause she didn't want him to watch porn and then he got busted doing it anyway all the time. So ensued the following conversation: 

Me: But I'm so tired of this narrative of like ""of course I'm gonna jerk of to another girks naked body when in a monogamous relationship, I'm a guy. It's impossible for me not to- my gf is just gonna have to get iver it"" like the idea that men are just naturally going to jerk it to porn and their gfs just have to accept that and take a backseat to some professional porn star is such a fucking dusty old ass frame of mind. It's 2022-- unlike before-- women can actually tell men what they are and aren't comfortable with and actually have a say in how their partner treats them and men just see it as women being ""crazy"" or ""unfair"" like fuck off maybe she just has different boundaries and self respect and doesn't want the guy who's only supposed to see her to be Cumming to some other woman getting fucked

Him: fair enough 

Me: are you agreeing cause you agree or agreeing cause you think that if u say anything to the contrary I will think ur a perv 

Him: I just don't care enough to delve super deep into the complex issues of men and women and blah blah it's like sure you're a woman you're probably right I'm a man I'm probably wrong if that's the way society works now I'm just ready to agree I think men can be pervs I don't think porn is that great for anybody's mind especially in access but really I'm just not into the whole man hating militant feminism thing I think it's just a fad 

Me: How is having boundaries about what you're comfortable with militant feminism? Would another word just be respect for your partner?

Him: I didn't say that anybody can do whatever they want I just thought it was a stupid funny story from work I'm not trying to turn this into 60 minutes or whatever that show is called I don't care what women do they can do whatever they want and it's fine I don't want to stop women from doing anything. Stop acting like a cop and trying to pick apart everything  this is a kid from work he's a kid he's a good guy maybe he made a mistake maybe he should have been more open with his girlfriend it was all suppose to be fuckin funny.

If you want to insult people on behalf of their veganism or lack thereof, kindly do it elsewhere**************

The last girl I was with took issue with my dietary choices even though I never mentioned being a vegan until we were about to share a dessert. Is this normal or was she a total psycho?

We had been on a couple of dates and on the third we went to a restaurant. She ordered something meaty and I ordered something vegan. We were both quite full by the end so she suggested that we share a dessert and be all cutesy - the waiter brought a dessert menu and she made the executive decision to order the cheesecake. At this I interjected and said something along the lines of

""ah, actually, sorry, I'm guessing the cheesecake isn't vegan is it...? If you're dead set on the cheesecake then I'll just order another""

She looked at me like I'd just murdered her entire family. ""You're a f***ing vegan?!""

""Yeah but it's not a big thing, I've got no problem with other people eating whatever they like""

""That's disgusting""

And then she basically stopped talking for the rest of the date and didn't offer to split the bill.

 She is the best girl I ever met, she has everything I look for in a girl and she is REALLY into me too. She wants to be my girlfriend. For the lasts 2 months she been indirectly telling me that she wants to make that step.


 I see myself spending the rest of my life with someone like her but this OF thing makes me feel insecure.


 I never expressed how this make me feel cause I thought it wouldn't be that bad and I could get over it, but I can't. 

 Maybe if I tell her how I feel she will just delete her account but a part of me thinks that's not fair to ask her to do that.

 So...

1) Is there some way to make me stop feeling insecure?

2) Is ok wanting to have exclusivity not only for sex but for those kind of pictures too?


Edit: She doesn't do it for the money, I'm sure about it, she just do it for fun, that's why I think is rude to ask her to stop.

Instead of going home after the long walk, we went for an early dinner, it was cute. If the sun didn’t set, we would probably have stayed longer!

Now I’m here raving about it. 


YAY

Edit: He also pulled my chair; fixed my hair on my face; when we hugged I could tell he was smelling me and he smelt so nice 🥺 As we were crossing the road, he I told him I felt bad for him being on the side of the cars and he said “that’s what I’m here for, you can use me as a shield”; he also was kind, funny, we had a very agreeable time and it felt very natural!! He even payed for my travel, which I feel bad for so I will make it up to him. 
In the train he let me rest my head on his shoulder, we kissed goodbye and I’m sure we’ll meet soon :) 
Would rather beat the iron while it’s hot as my sister said!

Second edit: He also told me that the day was long but it could have kept going, he didn’t realise it was so late. In the tube, I thanked him for touring me London, and he told me that he hoped it was as much of a pleasure for me, as it was for him.

432,Dating should be fun,"This will be my last post on this sub. From the post or comments I have read. I feel like most people are missing the point. Again dating should be fun. You get the opportunity to meet a new person to enjoy an activity with. Then if it leads to a second date, good. A third date, awesome. If it doesn’t, that’s cool too. Having a good time on a first date doesn’t mean it will lead to a second. Remember, the first date is seeing someone in person for the first time. If they are not into you, that’s ok. If your not into them, that’s ok as well. Don’t have this mind frame of being rejected. All it means they weren’t into you or compatible. I’d rather know now, than weeks or a month. 
Also things to consider 
1. Be Yourself
Meaning be truly honest of who you are and what you enjoy. Not what sounds good or what the other person wants to hear.For example, I enjoy watching Anime. Before I would never bring that up, but now I do, because it shows what I enjoy. You will be surprised that some will become interested on what you generally enjoy to do. 

2. The energy you give off is what you receive.
For example, If you have a mindset only men/women want hook up, or they are only after money, etc. that negative energy is going to come out in one form of another. The other person will know. Whether it’s how you speak, tone, body language or conversations that you have.

3. Don’t fall into dating myths
Women only want guys at a specific height or Women go on dates only for a free meal or activities. This are the most common things I’ve read. It’s not true. Can there be bad dates or people. Yes, but it does not generalize a whole sex or group of people. If I went on a date with a man, and been on his phone the whole time am I going to assume all men do this? No, this one person has bad manners. I’m not going to sum up all men do this, that’s crazy. Don’t let someone’s bad experiences influence you.

Edit: Thanks for the awards. I already unjoined this sub. because it was holding me back. I felt that there was not much support from this community. I felt hindering instead of helping, and negativity instead of positivity. I found another resource that will not only help me in dating, but to love myself, be aware of my flaws and be aware of my strengths. Dating is not a game that needs hacked, a scary villain, or a monster that needs to be destroyed. We are dealing with real people with real feelings. Some dates are good some are bad. It’s not perfect and it will not always go our way. Don’t hang onto negativity. What we can do is learn, help and support people going they the same thing. Remember we are dating for love, companionship, a connection. I wish everyone the best of luck.

434,I (21 F) believe casual sex (FWBs /One Night Stands) is ruining dating...," Don't get me wrong, casual sex is fine and good if you are in that space. I just think people are harming themselves by having friends with benefits/ one night stands while also getting to know other people. For instance my roomate (23 F) is dating this guy (29 M) for about a month and a half who I really lthink is great- he is a lawyer, has his head in the right place and is just all around a nice guy. But almost every night her friends with benefits (who is an exchange student from Jamaica that she really is supposed to be mentoring) is over and I hear them in the middle of the night having sex. Im not judging because her and the lawyer guy are not exclusive so she technically is single and can sleep with whomever. I just dont want her to lose a great guy over sex, because she seems to be finding ways to disqualify this new guy even though her reasons are trivial. A few of my friends are like this too, again I get it youre technically single so its fine and dandy.

439,"25 Hinge dates and still no relationship or sex. I feel defeated, hopeless, upset, frustrating, confused and not well","I downloaded Hinge in the middle of the pandemic and I put a lot of effort into my profile. It's a very solid profile and I'm very good at text messaging banter.

I've had 25 dates that never materialized into a relationship or sex or much of anything.

1st date: I rejected her due to lack of physical attraction

2nd date: I rejected her due to lack of physical attraciton

3rd date: We went on 3 dates, but she rejected me. She said ""our personalities don't mesh well, convos don't come easily, and she prefers to date a Christian man (I'm agnostic). We only hugged and held hands.

4th date: I rejected her after 2 dates due to lack of physical attraction. We pecked for a second at the end of the 2nd date.

5th date: I was ghosted

6t date: I was rejected due to ""life style differences."" I think this was a nice way of saying I'm much more broke than she is.

7th date: I was rejected due to ""I don't see this going further.""

8th date: I was rejected due to ""no chemistry. It's either there or not.""

9th date: We went on 4 dates. I REALLY liked this girl, but I would get so caught up in my head and really make any moves. We kissed 2-3 times (no making out). I was rejected because ""I don't think we're moving in a romantic direction. I look at you as a friend. There's nothing different you could have done."" I completely kick myself for not making moves when I had the window of time

10th date: I was rejected ""not the connection I'm looking for.""

11th date: I had 2 dates with this woman. Setting up dates with her was a total pain in the ass as she rescheduled multiple times. She rejected me saying ""I have a nervous energy about myself that makes her nervous and our connection is awkward.

12th date: We kissed at the end, and she said she wants to see me again, and then she blocked me by the time I got home.

13th date: Neither one of us reached out.

14th date: I rejected. She didn't talk with me, she talked AT me for 2 hours straight.

15th date: She rejected me. I texted her and told her how much I'm struggling, and she said ""for me it was a lack of physical attraction and I felt like you were too nerdy for my taste.

16th date: We had 2 dates. I kissed her at the end of the first one, we kissed at the lake on the 2nd one, and made out a bit by her car. She then rejects me 2 days later saying ""we're not compatible pass conversation and she's not over her ex.""

17th date-25th dates all just blend together.

443,[UPDATE] I [25M] have gotten into a casual relationship [27F] and feel like I'm using her,"Check previous post for more details if interested however TL;DR: title + she will only go down on me and won't let me reciprocate or have sex with her

I want to first off by thanking everyone for all your advice. It really gave me the courage to talk to her. As pathetic as that may sound. Things didn't go perfectly and in hindsight I should have done some things differently but it ended well. 

So she and I got together on Friday night. We had dinner, hung out then she started to initiate as she has done in the past. I stopped her and just held on to her and used the same words she used with me: 'this is all I need'. We cuddled for a little bit and she noticed my heart was beating really fast and she asked if I was okay. I told her I was nervous. I told her I want her to know that she doesn't need to go down on me to get cuddles. I told her that I really like her and I love when she goes down on me but most of all I like her company. I also told her that I would love it even more if I could make her feel as good as she makes me. At this point I could feel her tensing up which made me even more nervous. I reassured her that I'm happy with whatever she is comfortable with and I'm here for her if she needs to talk. She said thank you and we just cuddled in silence for a little while but I could tell she was still a little uncomfortable. 

After a while I noticed she had begun to cry then she started to tell me how she was feeling. She told me about her marriage. As I had suspected at the time, her husband was the first man she had ever been with. She was a virgin until she got married. She said she had a high sex drive and in the first month of marriage their sex life had been great. Shortly after that her husband started to pull away. He was refusing to have sex with her. She tried to talk to him to ask what was wrong but he would get angry. Whenever she initiated he would get annoyed and eventually got aggressive. She didn't know what she had done wrong. They went from having sex several times a week to once a month at most. She gave him the benefit of the doubt and thought that must happen with most marriages. The honeymoon period was over. 

After this he had even become emotional distant. He wouldn't kiss or cuddle her or show her any attention. She did her best to make him happy but nothing seemed to be working. The mentioned the only time she felt close to him was when he let her go down on him (which was more often than he would have sex with her) but even this wasn't as often as she would have liked. This went on for about a year. 

Sidenote: she often takes sleeping pills as she has insomnia. When she does, this knocks her out completely. She claims that you could probably cut into her and she wouldn't wake up. 

One night she woke up and found that he wasn't in bed.  She searched for him but he wasn't at home. She went to bed but stayed awake. A few hours later he came back. She didn't talk to him about it. She was more wary he did this quite often over the next few weeks. One night she left her phone in his car to find out where he had been going. She keeps her location on so she went back to check her timeline. She found out it was a house. The next night she confronted him when he got home. He claimed it was nothing and got angry. He got physical with her again so she dropped it. However after this she followed him one night after he had left. 

She found out he had been cheating on her since the early stages of their marriage. He had a girlfriend and a baby with this woman. She had also fallen pregnant but he had forced her to have an abortion. She said the whole experience made her incredibly insecure and she felt she wasn't good enough. He never reciprocated so she felt she wasn't worthy of being pleasure. It has affected her so much that she says she hasn't orgasmed since before she was married. The experience has also killed her sex drive.

She said she loves going down on me and didn't need for me to reciprocate. She said she didn't love going down on her husband as much as she loves going down on me. With him, she did it just to feel connected and close to him. She loves getting cuddles from me because her husband never did. She says she is starting to feel like her old self again and said she really likes me too. She's just scared if being hurt. Being vulnerable. But I'm going to do my best to show her her worth and treat her like she deserves. I reassured her. I asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted. 

It makes me so angry that he could do this to such a amazing girl. I hate that she was hurt physically and emotionally. All I can do is be there for her and take things slowly.

We spent the weekend together just hanging out and enjoying each other's company. I hope soon we can be physically closer but in the meantime I'm very happy with what we have. I know it's gonna take time but but she is well worth the wait.",ybevik,791,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ybevik/update_i_25m_have_gotten_into_a_casual/
444,"Always remember that if someone is interested in you, they will put in the necessary effort and make the appropriate ""room"" in their lives.","In spite of many men and women having busy schedules nowadays, when needed they will put in the necessary effort or make the ""appropriate"" room in their lives for a significant other.

If you happen to constantly experience rejection, regardless if the people you are interested in are in relationships or whatnot, it is definitely time to reassess your situation and circumstances, especially after said ""busy"" individuals do in fact decide to go on dates with others(that obviously ""appeal"" to them in some way, shape or form in contrast to yourself).

As we are all aware, human beings are social creatures, and while not everyone desires companionship, the overwhelming majority of us absolutely does, therefore when men or women are interested in someone, they will go to great lengths in catching, and keeping, their attention, even if they have demanding careers or other responsibilities(as if such individuals abstain from dating whatsoever).

P.S In conclusion, if a man or woman is interested in you, they would attempt to include you in their lives, so if you are not receiving the results you desire, there is probably an unspecified attribute that makes you ""disappear"" from your preferred interest's love radar.",uhi47p,792,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/uhi47p/always_remember_that_if_someone_is_interested_in/

446,(27M) I have been single and actively dating for the past year. Here are some basic things I have learned about first dates.,"Hey guys,

Been single for a year now and have gone on dates with around 30 or so different women. Some good, some not so good. Here is some basic advice for the guys here.

\*disclaimer: I met the vast majority of these women from Hinge, so take that into account

\*\*disclaimer 2: I am not trying to generalize all women in this post. There will be exceptions to these tips, as women are not a hive mind. These are just commonalities I have noticed while going on dates with different types of women with different backgrounds.

&#x200B;

**Before the date:**

You're exchanging messages back and forth. She's responding to you and putting in effort, not just one word replies. If you are having a consistent conversation with her, do not hesitate to suggest a date and move it over to texting. Women like men who know what they want, not someone who is going to beat around the bush and never pull the trigger. It is important you try to move off of the app and into the actual IRL date as quickly as you can. 

I always try to schedule the date within 3-4 days if they are available. Anything longer than that is less likely to happen. This will also prevent you two texting too much and either running out of things to say or losing interest or learning too much about them before the date which is where you really want to get to know them. I usually will say something like, ""If you're free on x day we should get drinks and get to know each other. What's your number?"". This will work 9 times out of 10 if the conversation was going well to begin with. 

Women like men who take initiative, so make sure you have a plan for your date (place and time, picking her up or meeting there, etc.). It will make her feel special and will show that you can take the lead and make decisions. I do not think any woman wants to plan a first date. You're the one asking her out, so you're the one who needs to plan. 

You're meeting this girl for the first time, so you don't need to pick anywhere super fancy/expensive or do anything crazy. There's a nice wine bar in my city that's not too expensive, it's casual and has a romantic vibe and it's a great date spot.

**The Date**

Your outfit, style, and grooming are important for making a first impression. Of course, looks aren't everything, but you want to present the best version of yourself. It says a lot about you and how you carry yourself. 

On most of my dates I wear something similar. Solid color t-shirt made out of good material and fits well, darker colored denim, slip on shoes that can be dressed up or down, and a minimal wrist watch. A good long sleeve button up shirt can work well too, especially if you roll up the sleeves. It sounds somewhat basic, but I have gotten a lot of compliments from girls on my outfit/style. The key is to find clothes that **fit you well** and not to go overboard with logos and accessories. 

So now you're at the date spot, looking damn good in your outfit. You're going to feel your stomach knot up when you see her walking towards you, but that's okay because she is feeling the same way, if not more nervous. 

Something I have noticed: women are often more nervous than you are. Sometimes they will even admit they are nervous. They have reason to be more nervous than you are, because they are meeting a strange man. So it's important that you are respectful to her and make her feel safe/comfortable.

I always give them a hug and tell them it's great to finally meet them. Do not overthink this, do not try to shake hands with them or make no physical contact for an introduction. She will feel safer with you and it will show you are confident and that you've done this before.

Now to get to know each other. Always make sure you're asking questions, and avoid talking about yourself the entire time (unless she asks you questions about yourself). If you're nervous, your instinct may be to start babbling, but she will pick up on that and no one wants to be on a date with someone who doesn't let them speak or show interest by asking questions. 

Make sure to give her some type of compliment. It doesn't have to be over the top, but sincere. You could say something like ""you look great"" which isn't inherently bad, but women (especially attractive women) get complimented on their looks all the time, so try to be a bit more creative. ""I really like your style/energy/vibe"" will go a longer way. Key is to compliment her on something she has control of, not just her genetics. 

**Be honest** about what you want and what you're looking for. I think it's common for a lot of guys to tell girls what they think they want to hear (""I'm looking for a relationship/something serious"") rather than what they are actually looking for (""I'm not looking for anything serious/dating casually""). Of course, if you are looking for a relationship then say that, but don't lie because you think it's what she wants to hear. You'd be surprised at how many girls are just looking for casual fun and not just boyfriends, and once you are both on the same page of what you want, everything will be a lot smoother.

Other general date tips: hold eye contact, have open body language, smile often, relax and act like you do this often (without saying it), avoid talking about polarizing issues, ex's, or other hot button topics.

When it comes to who pays, my rule is if you think the date went well and you want to see her again, **offer to pay**. It's likely she may suggest to split it, as many girls don't want to feel indebted to a guy the just met, and in that case split it. Either way, be prepared to pay the check if you like her and want to see her again. There is no shame in asking to split the check if the date did not go well or you don't see a future in this. 

After the check is taken care of, and assuming that it went well and you like her and want to see her again, here is what I do and it is always responded to very well: Hold her hand while you walk her to her car/ride. Don't announce it or make it weird, just do it. This used to make me nervous, but I have never had a girl respond negatively to that. It will show your confidence and ability to lead and make her feel safe. Plus, who doesn't want to be seen walking out with a pretty girl holding your hand/arm? Obviously don't do this if you have no interest/chemistry. 

I always go for the kiss after walking her to her car. Many girls want you to kiss them, and they don't want to make the first move, so give her a hug and as the hug is ending and your heads are lingering, just go for it. If she dodges you or says no then obviously respect her boundaries, but a turn on for a lot of women is a confident man going for the kiss and not being nervous about it or avoiding it. I have read on Reddit that some girls like when guys ask ""Can I kiss you?"", but I have also seen an equal amount of women say that they would be turned off by that. Read the room, and act accordingly, just don't be a creep or try to kiss her when she is clearly not interested. 

**After the date**

Assuming you both had a good time, got to know each other, and shared a kiss, text her and let her know you had a great time and would like to see her again. This will make her feel special and she won't question herself and wonder how you feel. This is where you can start to plan your next date. Maybe it can be something fun and adventurous, or maybe you're just going to have her come over if that's what you both want. Remember, you had a fun date but you aren't official and don't owe each other anything, so keep in touch with her but also give her some space. 

Overall one of my biggest pieces of advice is to just be the most confident version of yourself. This will look different on different guys, but she will appreciate this and you won't have to wonder if she likes you for you, or the act you put on for her. Maybe that version isn't going to be received well by one girl, but it could have another girl all over you for being your authentic self. 

I really hope this post helps any guys who are struggling. The first date is nerve-wracking, but after some practice it will feel much more natural and fun.",r9mtf3,790,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/r9mtf3/27m_i_have_been_single_and_actively_dating_for/

448,Worth getting a larger bed just for dating?,"I know only I can answer this question for myself, but is it worth getting a larger bed just for dating?

I have a twin and it's comfortable for sleeping. It's *maybe* a tad short but has never bothered me.

The last person I've slept with didn't make any comment, but I can imagine a bigger bed would make for a more fun/enjoyable time. 

Some of my friends (male/female) have made lighthearted jokes about having a small bed. They are good friends and I'm not offended, but it has made me think.

Obviously the reason I ask is because it's pretty expensive to buy a new mattress and frame. I'm not rich enough to make it a non-factor in the budget.

What are your thoughts? Would you be dissuaded after a first night over if it was a twin bed? You can be honest, that would be more helpful.

450,Friend says I make her question her celibacy?,"Hello, I've posted on here before but this situation is quite different. 

So I'm in Santa Monica for work and I visited a friend I met through my co worker. Met her last time I was in SM and she said to let her know when I'm back in town so I did. 

We hung out last night and had dinner, she had something to do in the morning so we turned in early. 

Late last night around 11pm she sends me a text saying ""Thanks for hanging out with me, we should do it again before you leave! I always enjoy talking with you even though by the end you make me question my celibacy! 😂""

I believe she's mentioned being celibate before, either she told me last time or my co worker said it. 

I guess it's worth noting that I myself have never been on a date or done anything with a woman before so I don't really know what to say here other than I wouldn't mind meeting up again if she wants to.

Although I'm only here for 4 more days and I have a lot of vital business to do and it would behoove me to prioritize that and preparations in my down time.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.

452,Should I warn him I’m chubby,"I (24f) have been talking to a guy (27m) I met through tinder for a few months and next week I am flying out to spend a week with him on the other side of the country. We talk in the phone regularly, we click so well that it almost feels silly worrying about this.

I’m generally pretty comfortable in my skin and I’m definitely comfortable saying I’m chubby. I think I carry my weight well in pictures and I don’t use Snapchat filters that thin my face or anything. I just don’t know if it’s worth pointing out before I get there? Is this more of an issue in my head or is respectful to him to let him know what he’s getting into?? 

Like I said, I’m pretty comfortable with how I look. I went on one really awful first and only date with a tinder dude a while back and he basically said I’m a catfish because he couldn’t tell that I was tall and chubby in my pics. He thought I was going to be short and cute and slimmer, and that’s just stuck with me a little bit.


Edit/Update: I got some really stellar advice here, and some really brutal comments that completely side stepped the point. I was super honest with him and brought it up and he was super understanding and reassuring. He was totally fine talking about the topic and I was open about why i was bringing it up and what my concerns about it were. I feel a billion times better and he was appreciative that I wasn’t trying to be any kind of deceitful or just not totally honest. 

All the other concerns I’ve been seeing:: I’m being very safe on the trip, I’m not at all concerned about that specifically. 
We have FaceTimed, but neither of us showed out entire bodies and it didn’t come up to do that. 
I don’t really use Snapchat so I don’t just send random selfies or mirror pics. I don’t take any weird poses that distort my figure, I just think I photograph well and it’s not intentionally hiding anything, it’s just not totally visible on a 2D format lol. 
Most of my tinder pics were full body pics.

Both appointments we spent just as much time talking about swimming and unrelated things as we did the injury. He swims as well, and we talked about where he swims vs. where I swim usually. 

He could just be incredibly friendly and have good bedside manner, so I would feel bad making him uncomfortable. But it also seems like maybe he is interested?

He’s very into sex, quite attracted to me sexually and occasionally would say things like “I really want to fuck you” because we haven’t had intercourse. Is this necessarily bad and disrespectful? This doesn’t happen too often, he says this with a loving tone when we are being intimate in other ways, and I didn’t really feel offended when he says this. But I want to check if this is some red flag that I am missing. He’s very respectful of me otherwise, especially of the boundaries I set. 

Want to hear what you think!

Edit: Thank you all for the responses, like one commenter said, Reddit is still a place of hope :) 

The majority of you find this not disrespectful given the context (that we are in a heated moment), and would find it at least weird if it comes from a stranger or at a less intimidate moment (say during dinner on a 3rd date). I tend to agree :)

Some of you encourage me to trust my own gut and thank you for that :) I guess what I am trying to get at is whether this is a universal red flag that I’m blind to, despite that I myself am not bothered too much with it. Happened before, where I would miss a red flag that is so obvious to others and lead into an unhappy relationship. The answer seems to be, no, this is not a universal red flag :) Knowing this, I’ll rely on my feelings more going forward. 

Some find it weird that I do not want to have sex or want him to want me. This is not true, of course I do. It’s the f word that I’m not sure about. People grow up in different environment. The way I grow up, the f word is not the best of words :) That is also why i can understand where he comes from using this word, this is simply not that profane of a word for him and probably very appropriate if used as a dirty talk.",ryj4tl,765,210,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ryj4tl/is_i_want_to_fuck_you_necessarily_a_sign_of/

We were writing back and forth for a bit of time and she was answering pretty fast. It took her 30 min to maximum 2 hours to answer. Now I said something that sounded ambigious, even though I didn't plan to be.

She explained her plans for the weekend.
I said something like: ""I'm gonna have fun with myself""
She said: ""your weekend plans sound a bit suggestive.""
So I rolled with it and said: damn you're right, that wasn't my intention. What I meant was, that I will masturbate all weekend long, without a break, nonstop and so on 😂 please excuse me that joke 😜""
I also wrote what I really meant by saying ""having fun with myself"", which was just normal stuff. I also added a question to her plans.

Now she hasn't replied on that message in a day and I almost wanted to apologize for that stupid joke.

I found it quite funny when I thought about it, so I wanted to be couragious and bring some humour into the conversation. 

The question is, if I already fucked up and should I write again, ignoring what I said or apologizing for the joke?

Can one stupid joke fuck up all the dating experience and is there even a chance to recover from that. I mean if she would have found it funny I would've get a reply by now.
 What advice can you give me?

466,boyfriend (18M) being pushy about sex with me (18F),"first time posting here and im so conflicted I can’t think straight anymore I really need advice

im super new to this whole relationship thing so I dont really know my footing, but basically my partner has a stupid high libido (im not saying being sexually active is a bad ting!! frankly i dont care, but its just something I personally cannot keep up with) and constantly wants to be sexually intimate with me. we see each other about 2-3 times a week and almost every time there will be some part where we get intimate. however i’ve stated my boundaries and stood my ground that I was not comfortable with penetrative sex at the moment. even though he was upset, he respected it and said he would wait till I was ready

however, I still somewhat feel not right about this situation. every time we have had sex (mainly restricted to oral and hand jobs) he would ask whether I was ready (for penetrative sex) to ‘feel good with me’. additionally, some days he would hint for wanting a second round and for me to ‘help him out’ though we’ve already done stuff in the morning/ afternoon of

as of now, im going through a relatively stressful period in my life. my parents separated last year and i’ve been trying to recover from an eating disorder and manage my anxiety around this time, (which i was just diagnosed with this year). also, my exams are ongoing and this year is especially important due to uni applications to be done using this years grades. basically a lot is happening right now. 

he also has his own personal struggles such as clinical depression and having previously had bad sexual encounters (r*** basically) which is why he highly values sexual intimacy and wants to have it with me

once he got pretty aggressive (edit: in a bdsm sense cause of a mood shift) during sex and I got really afraid (edit: that he would go too far and not stop) and had a panic attack. I was crying non stop and was shaking uncontrollably, he immediately stopped and comforted me till I felt better. (edit: so was it all my anxiety?) additionally he has continually given me affirmations about my body knowing that I have very low self esteem on that aspect.

but in general him continually asking if im ok with penetrative sex has made me very uncomfortable. I feel pressured that I am obliged to do so to prove my love for him cause he admitted that he doesnt really feel it at the moment. I’ve been feeling increasingly on edge whenever we have had sex and sometimes it feels more like a chore. (though i admit it does feel nice) he complains about my libido and tries to turn me on to coerce me into having sex which leads me to feel even more guilty when I reject him. he asks me about why im not comfortable to try to help me be okay with it but honestly i dont know, but im just not ready for it at the moment. now seeing him makes me anxious cause i dont want to let him down and knowing i disappointed a person i deeply care about really hurts me. I feel happy in this relationship, but this has made me feel increasingly stressed. I’m content about it, but he’s not??

ive been feeling so lost its gotten to a point where I have had dreams about being r**** (I think to symbolise my feelings of helplessness and the amount of pressure im feeling from having to sexually satisfy someone), my dreams have always been very vivid and representative of my mental state whenever im at a low point 

I dont know whether its me that’s the problem in being afraid of sex in general and hence not feeling sexually attracted to him or whether its him being pushy, what do you guys think?

TLDR: boyfriend pushy about sex but cares about me, I feel conflicted and anxious. im content but he’s not. what do I do?

edit: I started antidepressants this year and prior to that I did engage in pornography + masturbation so I dont think im necessarily asexual..? maybe it’s the medication I have no clue but I just feel overwhelming fear when it comes to doing it with another individual

467,Did we have sex too quickly?,"NSFW I met this guy on Tinder and we had a great first date. One week later we had our second date, 1st kiss and eventually led to sex (3 times!!). Frankly I really wanted him - I haven't had actual sex for at least 8 months and he's just so damn cute and sexy! so...... The second day I told him thinking about yesterday made me smile, and he acknowledged that and said he felt the same.

Two days after the 2nd date we met again - I made dinner and we ended up in bed again - twice lol.

We know a bit about each other but obviously not enough - dating goals etc. At this point I think he's absolutely a gem and I adore him so much.

He's REALLY good in bed and the two days we had sex was the best experience for me ever. We couldn't get off each other. Last time we were together I said I wish you could stay for the night. He said if so we wouldn't sleep the whole night 😅 we'll leave the sleepover for one of the weekends.

On the third date while having dinner, I asked him what's the most courageous thing you did? He thought for a bit and said the recent one was that he kissed this girl on a bench..... (He's a shy and introvert person, I had to give him hints like crazy to make him kiss me)

When I'm with him everything is fast-tracked. I'm honestly a bit scared - I'm definitely falling for him.

Some people say having sex too soon wouldn't lead to a real relationship and future. But we already had sex. I couldn't turn that back.

I wonder 🤔 if having sex too fast was a mistake???????

\--------++++--1st Update--+++++++-------

Thank you all for the comments. So far I think the popular opinion is that when having sex is not that important but communication is.

We had great convo on our dates especially the 1st one. We were laughing nonstop. We still wanted to talk but sex got into the way. So next time seeing him, I'll definitely make an effort to open up and talk more instead of sex.

We had a good moment after one of the sessions - we found out that we love a movie that a lot of people don't. Funny enough - we both cried while watching it. That feeling was great too.

We asked each other lots of questions already, and shared many important (even bad) moments about ourselves. I guess that's why we feel connected.

We still have a list of questions to go through.... And I look forward to doing this with him :)

\------++++----+++++2nd Update if anyone cares----------------------+++++++++++

So last weekend he went home and visited family, which gave me a bit of time to reflect on what I wanted. I was actually sick for the weekend and took Monday off. I do want to build a deeper connection with him and hopefully can lead to a relationship. I texted him on Monday (yesterday) and we exchanged a few messages, and somehow turned into semi-sexting over the day ........ In the evening he was quite turned on and insisted on coming over. When I see him, I would tremble a bit without doing anything.... and just wanted to jump on him immediately.... Anyways the whole evening turned into a pretty much full-on hot af sex session (3 times again!..).... We both enjoyed it so much.

We only got to chat a little bit in the end.... but didn't get to any of the deep questions. Tired and ran out of time.

Eventually, I asked him, I want to know you more, would that be ok? But every time I see you can't keep my hands off you though. He said yea of course, do you want to take sex off the table? I said no...... it's too good! But occasionally?

Before he left, I emphasized again that I want to know him more. So he suggested that we meet again over the weekend to do some daytime activities. He said I think if it's daytime and out of the bedroom, it would be easier..... Let me think about what to do!

So far that's where it is.....

470,I didnt sleep with him and now he isn't talking to me...,"SO, I met a man **8 days ago**, and he is everything I ever asked for. Our first date was great, we went out for drinks, I drank too much and had to go back to his place. We kissed a lot and I was okay with that mostly because of the initial attraction and the alcohol. At some point he takes off his pants and put my hands on his stuff, I go with it even though I didnt want to. He tried to go further and I shut it down, as I had met that man just a few hours ago.

A few days later, we go to yoga together. pretty good experience, he did try to eat my face in the parking lot but it was alright.

The third time we met was yesterday, he made me a really nice dinner w wine and we saw some Christmas lights. We go back to his place and of course he tries again , while i'm just trying to cuddle and watch a show on Hulu... We went to bed and then he tried it again. I Said no, again. He also tried again this morning when we both woke up at like 7 am. I turned the other way. Its just as annoying to say no as it is to hear it.

When I am in his presence I am somewhat troubled by the fact that I have to fight him off of me at some point because he wants to constantly kiss and grab my butt whether we are in public or at home.

Any time we kiss he wants to stick his tongue down my throat, and literally spit in my mouth. It bothers me the first day we met he tried to sleep with me. He is a pretty nice guy, really intelligent, independent, well spoken, kinda overbearing physically, but I am interested in dating him, **im just not comfortable to do all of that stuff now, as we just met**. He speaks and treats me as if he likes me and not just trying to have sex with me but I dont know. he tells me how pretty I am and how perfect I am often. He says physical touch is his love language and I get it. After not sleeping with him last night, he has not spoken to me today, when I asked him if we could talk about it, he said ""I'm Busy rn""

But I think I made a mistake in texting her afterward saying if she'd like to hang at my place, watch a movie or something. And I think that's why there's this 3 day gap. I did apologize for asking that and she said ""thats okay"". Well now I know not to do that. Maybe from now on I should suppress my interest in the opposite sex. Is it normal to be interested/attracted to someone right off the bat?  What if that happens again with another girl? Should I start off as friends with her while hiding my interest?

I don’t know why I feel this way and it makes me feel TERRIBLE because I don’t want them to feel lead on.

473,Who messed up?,"I (28m) was supposed to meet a (26f) for a first date. We matched on an app. We set the date yesterday and told her I was excited. I was at work and it was getting busy so I tried wrapping up the conversation by saying “I have a long day ahead of me. I bet you do too so have a good day!” She replied “ I have a long but slow day but thank you. You too!” I thought that was the end of the conversation. 

As I was getting ready tonight I decided to send her a text saying hey I’m on my way she you soon. She replies I’m so sorry I though since I didn’t hear from you we weren’t going anymore. So I made last minute dinner plans with a friend. 

I told her what I thought my side was. She explained that she felt like it wasn’t a good sign that I didn’t keep talking to her and felt ghosted. I told her I’m definitely interested and that I’m sorry she felt ghosted. She then says we’ll to be honest, this is the first time I’ve used an app and another guy messaged me around the same time as I did and we’ve been talking. I don’t feel comfortable continuing things with both of us at the same time. I’m really sorry. I said I gotcha. Well I’m sorry you felt like I ghosted you. Don’t believe in ghosting hahah. Honestly I was excited to see you and was hoping we’d hit it off 

I’m thinking a couple things. If she wasn’t sure then why didn’t she just text me? Double text I guess? Just being nice and blowing me off? Or I messed up? Literally made plans yesterday and figured we’d save the real conversation for the date",xaalak,741,323,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xaalak/who_messed_up/
474,My highschool crush finally gave me a chance and I wish he didn’t,"I (26F) had a crush on this guy (27M) for 10 years now. When he was a senior in highschool I was a junior and he would never even look my way. He was the jock type and I was the opposite. I had friends but I lacked the popularity he had. What attracted me most to him was the fact that he was quiet. He seemed like a mystery. People flocked to him. When he graduated I sent him a friend request and he accepted. Fast forward to a week ago he wrote me on IG and asked for my number and I gave it to him. He texted me and we’ve been talking for the past 6 days and I wouldn’t trade those days for anything. Today I mustered up the courage & texted him and asked him if he wanted to go out on a date. He said no he would rather stay home and chill and invited me over. I went all out and did my hair, picked out a really cute outfit and even used some seductive perfume. I wanted him to impress him badly! I make it to his house and when I get there the conversation was very limited and he spent the whole time playing a video game. I felt like crap! He didn’t even notice my effort. I made attempts to make conversation and I got 1 word replies. 1 hour after I left I see he posted a reel of a guy saying how he didn’t get any “vajayjay” and I feel disgusted. I wasn’t ready for that but I feel like if he would’ve put any effort into the conversation things would’ve been better. I feel like a loser because I craved this guy for 10 years and it wasn’t worth it but I also wonder if he expected me to make the first move.",ughlrw,742,151,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ughlrw/my_highschool_crush_finally_gave_me_a_chance_and/

This podcaster was discussing being ghosted after sex, and the whole debate about it. Brought up an interesting view point: ""It doesn't matter when you have sex with a guy, you could wait a month or have sex on the first date, and while waiting longer can create a deeper emotional connection, men normally realize their true intentions with a woman after sleeping with them."" Thought it was an interesting take!

478,The girl I am dating uses a lot of abusive language towards me and in general. How do I politely bring it up since it's quite offensive?,"M31 have been dating 27F. She uses the choicest of abuses when talking. She does it to her friends too but they are accustomed to it. Like she says - motherfuc*er, bastard, son of pig, son of a bitch a lot. Mostly it's in an endearing tone. So If we are kissing and I tease her a bit over something she directly calls me mother*cker. Or bastard. So to be clear we are not fighting or being rude. It's all fun. And she does it whenever I say something that makes fun of her(she's making fun of me all the time). 

She's also in the habit of calling herself ""alpha woman"" and refers to me as ""beta"". Anytime I do something which involves broad consensus like asking my mom (I do it because we have a great relationship and she likes if I involve her) if I should get a dog since she stays with me (she lost her home so I help her out, she's my mom) and would have to help in taking care of it, she calls me beta. ""You are beta so it's expected of you"". She says it even in front of her friends. In a mocking tone. Trying to make fun of me. 

Her friend told me to not mind it since that's just her way of flirting with me. 

It's frankly quite rude to be honest to call some mother*ucker for no reason. How do I bring it us as she has rebuffed me when I said you abuse a lot by saying ""you always bitch too much about everything""

(Secondary edit: I've been barred from commenting so just to clarify I'm a cis white guy, 
I'm not a woman, 

also you can't expect me to reply to your anecdotes anymore, all I can say is if you're refuting this you're probably a terrible partner who just happens to be ugly, and you blame your failures on your appearance instead of looking at yourself on the inside)

I know a lot of you are looking for advice with women 

and you'll often come across these poorly shaven chuds who tell you that you need to be buff and rich and all this other guff,

 (as they don't really see women as people, rather they see women as prizes that go to the most protein guzzling alpha) 

but you just need to be passionate about something, 
the reason why so many people claim their physical beauty is the reason why they're so lonely is because they're sad about how they look. That creates a cycle where they just get sad about how they look, their sadness makes them undesirable, they get sad about that, blame their physical appearance for their undesirability and it just goes on and on until they're in a dangerous place.

Whereas there are plenty of men who aren't considered conventionally attractive who are dating women who are and visa versa

I have a friend she's very attractive and her boyfriend is overweight, is still in education and hasn't shaved in Frankly too long but he's a genuine and sweet guy who's always trying to make her happy, even if he gets a little defensive about her hanging out with majority male groups he still loves her and she loves him

Because as cliché as it sounds people are more attracted to personality than anything.

Obviously women aren't a monolith and neither are men but it's worth pointing out how much people desire genuine people over someone who either has looks and nothing else or someone who just has nothing.",rkmirk,734,383,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rkmirk/the_most_attractive_thing_in_a_man_is_how_happy/

Example: We go out to dinner, he will post his plate of food as if he were alone. Before he used to post both plates, we go to a park and he will only post his bike, etc. etc.

Also, for everyone asking about my age and why I care about social media, it has nothing to do with that. It's the drastic change in my partner from doing it to nothing.

482,He thanked me for sex?,"UPDATE(for those who replied) 
 F(21) I’ve been in a sexual relationship with a guy M(21) I knew from high school for 2 years now. I guess we’ve grown to be friends, I wouldn’t say we’re close because we do not discuss personal things on the regular. Unless we see one of us is in serious distress do we ever get mushy. 

We recently began calling each other ‘baby’ and shit like that, but not on the regular it’s more like ironically. We never meet unless we’re having sex and it’s been like that for the 2years. I we went out 3 times maybe and they ended in sex.    

We had sex last night and after he texted me to make sure I was home he said , “okayy thank you” and this morning when I saw his text I asked “for what” and he said “for giving me a piece of your pie” ?????? Tf does that mean

484,"If you are carrying the conversation all the time, move on, don't waste your time and effort","We all know the feeling, the feeling that we are the only one putting in the effort, the one who is carrying the conversation, it feels off, and so it should. We appreciate it when our efforts are reciprocated, reciprocity shows that both parties understand that social interactions are supposed to be mutually beneficial. 

When your efforts are not returned, immediately this is a red flag, generally if they are not reciprocating, they are likely not interested in you and/or in it for their own gain. I have given people the benefit of the doubt, especially when it is over text, as text is such a poor communication tool, it is hard to fully comprehend someone's intentions as our own subjectivity can completely distort the meaning behind text more so than any other form of communication. It turns out my initial doubts were always correct. 

When you get that feeling in your gut that says ""this just does not feel right, why do I seem to making all the effort?"" Just move on. Don't waste your time. Don't give your energy to someone who will not appreciate it or give it back to you in return. If they are still interacting with you in such a one sided manner, consider why are they even continuing in that interaction at all?  The chances are it is for totally selfish reasons. You are being used by them to satisfy some need(s) of theirs. The minute they do not need you, they will drop you without a second thought. Don't bother.

486,How creepy would you find it if a guy you're seeing left you a small care package on your doorstep after a rough day?,"Somewhat long post so I'll put TL'DR at the bottom.

So for some context, I (23M) have been seeing this girl (21F) for about a month now. We've been on 5 dates in person, all of which have gone extremely great, always extending to 9-10 hour in length. As well as on days we don't see each other, playing games or talking on the phone until 3 or 4 in the morning and texting throughout the day. We also live about 50 minutes away give or take.

&nbsp;

Yesterday I didn't hear from her very much and we only exchanged probably 3 or 4 texts. She works late nights and doesn't get off until 11pm. 

After she gets off work she sends me a text basically saying she was sorry for the lack of responses today and that she's gonna go to bed early because she was having a really rough day, and that work was crazy which didn't help. I tell her I'm sorry to hear that and ask if she wants to talk about it, to which she replies ""No I'm okay. I think I need the night to myself though""

I wanted to give her a little bit of space to relax and do whatever she needs to do so I told her I understand and for clarity and my sanity, asked if I had done anything to upset her. To which she assured me ""no not at all"". And now still haven't talked to her since about midnight last night.

I'm planning on reaching out before I go to sleep if she doesn't and saying something along the lines of ""hey, just wanted to check in and say hi. I hope today was better than yesterday!""

I'm a very caring person and her main love languages are receiving gifts and words of affirmation. So I was thinking I would drive up and leave her a little handwritten note that just says something super simple to show I care but nothing overboard because we're still relatively new to each other. as well as maybe her favorite candy or something else small like an oragami flower.

I'd like to drop this off about 10-20 minutes before she's off so that she'll get it when she comes home from work. Is this too creepy since we're still new? She said she's also a hopeless romantic type and loves romanticism and cheesy gestures. I don't want to lay on too strong over this and scare her or anything. I'm just second-guessing because I really like her.

**TL;DR:**

I want to drop off a small care package for the girl I've been dating/seeing for the past month. She had a very bad day and we haven't talked all day since last night when she told me. I have been to her house before and it is about a 50 minutes drive. How would you feel if a guy did this?

495,"NSFW to give oral, or not to give?","UPDATE: Thank you all for all the comments, stories, and everything else you've provided me. There is a lot of good shit here that I really tried to read everything and consider all of it. 
So yesterday morning starts and hes all over me, kissing me, cuddling me and even rubbing me. After a few minutes of kissing, he slips his hand in my pants, and starts rubbing around. I was kind of shocked because this had never happened. I thought for a second, ""wait, did he see me reddit post??"" I didnt have to ask or even put his hand there, he just did it??? He still didn't finger me or go down but he at least played with it so thats a good sign. We continue to have sex and it was fucking great. I came all over the place, he came all over the place, it was hot and passionate and I was completely satisfied after. So after we were finished we decided to get in the shower and I thought this would be a great time to open up about this. I start to tell him how much I love him touching me, I like watching you do these things, its great blah blah blah. So I then ask, ""do you not like fingering, or have you tried with anyone?"" And he said ""my ex didn't like it so I didn't do it with her. Its just gets messy sometimes."" He tells me that it's not that he doesn't like to do it but the women he's been with have been weird about it. He said he tried with one and she freaked out, he had no clue why she freaked out but she apparently didn't like it. He then asked if I liked it, I said ""of course! Its great!"" And he smiled at me and said ok. Later on we continuing the conversation, I had told him I didnt want to make him uncomfortable or force him to do something he didn't want to do. He said, "" its not that, youre not doing that. Im a selfish lover and shouldn't be"" I didnt even have to hint around that, he just said it himself. So I said, ""yup that's very selfish."" He then said ""we have to talk about these things. If you want me to do it, I will because I dont want to fuck this up.""
Hes always been so easy for me to open up and talk to so I dont know why I was afraid in the first place. After all this, im glad I didn't dump him just because he didn't go down on me. There's more than that here. And if he's wiling to try, that's all im can ask for, willingness. That tells me its more than that for him, too. 


Hi all! Im looking for some advise because I'm not sure how to feel about this situation or how to resolve it. 
My boyfriend, (38m), and I, (32f), have been together for a little over a year and the relationship is great! Hes became my best friend over the course of our relationship, hes very sweet, caring, and respectful. Everything I've ever wanted, minus one thing; he doesn't do oral. Every single time we have sex, I give him oral to get him going, sometimes ill even give during sex. I like giving oral and want to keep doing it, but I'd also like the same attention paid to me as I do to him. Hes tells me all the time how attracted to me he is, how much i turn him on, I have a killer body, but the only thing he touches on me are my tits. He told me once before that he didn't like oral but didn't elaborate much more other than, ""I just don't like it."" Is this ok or a red flag? How can I communicate with him that I'm being left wanting more and how can I encourage him to do this without making him feel inadequate? Should I stop giving oral if im not getting it in return? Sometimes I feel stupid for getting annoyed by this, but other times it really frustrates me.
EDIT: Someone pointed out that i didn't include in my post if I told him I liked it, I have expressed to him that I liked receiving it just as much as giving it. Thats when be said he just didn't like it. He didn't elaborate on why or if he had a bad experience. He did say he has done it before.

497,"Taking things ""too quickly"" is a myth","Don't go about your relationships scared of taking things too quickly. Obviously have your own friends, hobbies, interests etc. but if you love her, say so. Don't not say it because it feels too soon. If you want to hang out, hit her up. 

Don't avoid difficult conversations; they'll come up sooner or later so better talk about them sooner instead of wasting time and finding out later that it's a deal breaker. And for the love of God don't play stupid games where you act distant to make her chase you. When you meet ""the one,"" she'll reciprocate. If not, it'll burn out quickly and it just means you didn't waste any time with someone who you weren't compatible with.",v30vyj,714,112,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v30vyj/taking_things_too_quickly_is_a_myth/

Since then, I've gone off the idea. I would rather be in a relationship, or not in one. And I don't like the idea of being exclusive without a proper relationship tag as well. (I get that this works for some people though)

501,Tired of how men view me,"I just… I’m lost. I (25f) recently slept with a close friend of 10 years (25m) and it felt like the second we had sex I became some kind of object to him. It was fun for him to use me emotionally. I thought we were best friends… I didn’t know that this would change as much as it did…but he took it as an opportunity to be rude to me and then gaslight me into believing I was only upset because he wasn’t giving me enough attention. For example we were out at a bar and I was literally speaking to him like normal and he was so rude to me the whole night. When I left he made up some BS excuses that I was just more sensitive now- but he never would have called me annoying or called me names before we hooked up so something changed on his end, not mine and I wasn’t being dramatic by being hurt by that. 

I don’t know if I’m finding the wrong people- but I’ve realized the second I sleep with a guy, even in this case after years of friendship— I feel like their perception of me changes. I’m a conquest that they now are over with. It’s so exhausting. I don’t know exactly what advice I’m looking for except how do you keep your spirits high when you have been disrespected like that?

So he came over to my house for the first time, and as soon as he came in I smelled it 😭😭😭 like onions, STRONG, it was terrible. My couch and bed are still infused with the stench. Before leaving he showered and my towels all reak of it now 😭😭😭😭 it’s god awful. He’s such a good guy and I can see a future with him but I know I this is a problem. I know I could just tell him but, the problem is I’m wondering if this is his norm.
He asked me about my “grooming habits” a while ago. I told him I don’t like having hair downstairs and I keep it clean of course. And he told me in response to that, “well I prefer a woman with a bush and her natural scent, I’m not telling you what to do but do with that information as you please I’ll love it either way”. I fear he wants to stink together. Maybe I’m overthinking. I don’t know. I don’t want to talk to him about it because I never want anyone to change for me, in the long run the end I fear he won’t have what he prefers and he will end up unhappy. 
Thoughts or any advice? 😭 good god I’m smelling the aftermath as I write this. Help😭

✨ Update:
Cut him off a week after posting this (due to many factors, not just the stench)
I didn’t have the heart to tell him, I kindly let him know we were simply incompatible and wished him the best. 
But boy those few days after his wrath were menacing, despite my efforts to clean and make my own home smell good again 😭 just couldn’t do that again.

When I walked in, we saw each other and waved. The worker asked for vaccine card and ID. I couldn't find my ID in my purse. I texted my date that I don't have my ID and went to my car to look for it. After about 20 minutes, he texted me saying that he is going to head home. I kept trying to convince him to not leave and apologized for making him wait. I called him a few times and no answer. After he got home he texted me saying that he don't take what happened personally but not down to meet up again. I know I screwed up and made myself look bad. I don't think he thought I bailed because he asked if I wanted to go somewhere else that doesn't require a vaccine card and ID. Is it a big deal that made him wait 20 mins? I thought his decision to leave and end things was a bit harsh but understandable. What are your thoughts?

Edit: I knew the place we're meeting at checked IDs and vaccine cards. I had digital vaccine card. Prior to leaving the house, I didn't check if I had my ID because I assumed I had it in my wallet.

But here is the deal, people are not ""mind-readers"", it is impossible for them to ascertain what one actually means with that phrase.

It may as well refer to a friendly ""get-together"" as much as a ""date"".

Some may even imply the above phrase somehow ""relieves the pressure"" from the other party by keeping the interaction as casual as possible, however if the other individual feels ""pressured"" because someone else is expressing interest in them, they have some serious growing up to do as they are probably too immature themselves.

512,Here's what I do before going on any dates,"Dates are unpredictable. You may have the best connection over text but zero chemistry in person. The opposite is just as valid. But whether you get rejected, you're not interested or it went very well, clean your place before going.

I've been consistent with that and it changed my experiences a lot. I take the time to make my bed, sweep the floor, do all my dishes, put some insence, other chores etc...

Imagine going to a bad date or get rejected, then heading back home a little bummed out to remember you've clean your whole place and it smell good! Everything looks nice. It's a mood booster trust me.

Same apply for a great date. It will allow you to just sit down with a whisky/wine and just enjoy the moment without any little task to distract you. There's nothing to worry about other than being present.

Best case scenario you are both coming back together. You won't be anxious about your place, in fact you might be proud to show it. Most women appreciate a man that takes care of their place. As a man I also pay attention to that when I go to theirs.

514,Nicest Way to Cut Someone off Due to Weight Preference?,"I (28m) recently matched with a woman on a dating app and the conversation has gone pretty well. We’ve been talking for about 2 weeks and we scheduled a date for this weekend.  I would typically ask for a girl’s IG along with their number, but she gave me her number pretty quickly (I didn’t ask - she just offered it to me). 

Yesterday I texted her one of my IG pics and then she followed me.  I followed her back and she is.. quite a bit heavier now than she is in her pics on the app.  Like easily 30+ pounds heavier (probably closer to 50). The most recent pic she used from her IG is from 2019. I’ve got a pretty vast weight/shape range that I’m attracted to, but she’s just too big for my  taste.  What’s the most tactful way to cancel the date?  She’s very sweet but I really don’t want to waste time or money on someone I’m not physically attracted to.  I’m not trying to body shame her though (even though she didn’t use any of her more recent pics so  she clearly knows something has changed🙃).

Edit: Thank you so much for all the replies.  I’ll probably just give a vague reason (seeing someone else, trying to workout with ex, etc.) and I’m not gonna bring up the weight unless she presses me about it.  I’m not interested in “teaching her a lesson” because that doesn’t benefit me at all and only serves to possibly hurt her feelings more.

516,My hobbies and meetup groups are sausage fests - what now? (rant),"tl:dr, workplace sausage fest, hobbies sausage fest, DETEST online dating, have life now but no sexy single women in my area, what do?

&#x200B;

I'm a workaholic. I'll just say it. Oh sure my friends have invited me, some practically begged me to go hang out with them but I've always given the excuse of ""I'M POOR"" or ""I'm BUSY!"".

Well, fast-forward 4 years. I'm not poor anymore. In fact, I'm moderately well off and now have time to actually have a fucking life for once. I always wanted to learn sword-fighting so I signed up for Longsword Fundamentals, I've always wanted to ride a motorcycle so I joined a few motorcycle clubs. I also like hiking so now I'm part of a hiking club as well. I also volunteer at a food bank as part of my upper-middle-class guilt repentance program.

Here's the problem. If I walk through one of those meetups and just stick my hand out at waist level and just grab it, I'll be treated to more sausages than the meats section at a Walmart.

Back in high school the way I met my first gf was basically through forced intimacy of teachers assigning my seat next to a girl and over time we just kinda just became a thing. Probably how I met most of my exes but now working in a 99% male environment and having 99% male hobbies, I'm kinda lost.

I detest online dating. If I wanted to prostrate myself in front of millions of people and kiss babies and punch Nazis on camera I would have become a politician.

I don't like drinking. I've done shrooms, weed, lsd, all sorts of liqueurs and funny gas, they just make me feel terrible. I don't like it. So that rules out going to the bar unless I want to be the guy who orders sparkling water and kill everyone's buzz.

519,AITA because I've lost interest because the sex was bad. Probably TMI and NSFW,"I am 31f and I've been dating this guy 36m for almost 3 months now. He is amazing in many ways, great to talk to, patient with me, super nerd, has some good things going for him, but he is not my body type preference. I've gained a good amount of weight during covid as well, so I don't feel quite comfortable with my own body right now either. 

He has gone down on me once previously. But we finally had sex when I came over to hang out with him on Christmas Day. We we're making out for a while until we started playing with each other (He was hard). He asked to go down on me and his oral play was fantastic. When he came back up (He was still hard) I went down on him (instantly soft). I haven't had sex for like 2 years now so I'm thinking I'm out of practice. We switch back to making out (rock hard). He ask if he should grab a condom, I'm pretty excited and say yes. After he puts the condom on he goes down on me again, for a while, then comes back up to make out with me. I can feel that he is hard and ready but he doesn't make the next moves, so I initiate. I climb on top to ride and soon as he is in he starts to deflate. We're pushing rope for a minute. We made a few more attempts with little success. He goes back down on me and when he came back up (rock hard). By this time I've orgasmed a couple times, again his oral skills were fantastic. We make out some more and he cums from a hand job. He later tells me he thinks he was just nervous, which I am understanding of.

A few days before Christmas we started talking about travel plans, but I feel myself kind of slipping since then. He text me more frequently, but it takes me longer to respond. My last relationship was difficult because we were not really sexual compatible and I kind of have a fear that it could be the same with this guy. 

I liked him alot but I can't help but wonder AITA for losing interest. 
It could've honestly just been nerves. Should I sleep with him again to see if anything changes? Should I let him go?

**Update**
Guy I am dating and I did talk about this shortly after and he expressed that he was just in his head and got nervous. I asked if there was anything I could do to help and he told me no there was nothing extra I needed to do. I am happy and appreciative that he continued pleasing me instead of just stopping.

But my reason for losing interest and kind of slipping away is because I've dealt with a partner who I was sexually incompatible with. My ex and I were together about 7 yrs, he was a great guy in many ways but his sex drive was much lower than mine. I was patient and understanding but apparently me bringing this up and trying to talk about it and helping to fix it was emasculating. So I stopped bringing it up out of fear it would start an argument. 

Whenever my ex and I would finally have sex it was nice but it seemed like 3 out of 4 times of me asking/begging he was not be in the mood. We lived together and were only having sex like once every 2 months, but I wanted to more and that was an issue and it lead to problems later. 

It has been about 2 yrs since I last had sex and I now have a fear of denial of sex when I really like someone. So I don't feel comfortable initiating sex because of that fear. And I really don't want to go through the anxiety of being scared of asking for sex again in a relationship.",rqwi2d,686,295,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rqwi2d/aita_because_ive_lost_interest_because_the_sex/

522,My favorite ghosting-prep tip for a date!,"I just wanted to share my favorite tip for dates which makes dating a lot less of a pain. Note: this applies to in person dates. 

So my first dates are always coffee dates at a nice place on campus and my approach is always the same. I show up early and bring a laptop to do work (studying mostly but whatever you need to get done).

Scenario 1: Date shows up, I put away my laptop and greet them. What I was studying is often a question I get asked and is a great way to start a convo.

523,"GUYS, do you lose interest on girl if you have sex on first date?","It has happened to me several times over the years that guy loses interest on getting to know me if we had sex on first date. I've been at most offered fwb, because they ""don't see me as gf material"". 

If it's in the air I like to let things flow to that point. I'm very passionate person and enjoy sex a lot. For me the best type of sex would be in relationship though so I do meet people with intention to get to know them. I find it interesting that having sex soon would ""not make me gf material"". I don't based on my bf material criteria on if guy has sex with me but in overall compatibility, how he treats me and others and his overall character.

I'm 23 years old and I've never had a girlfriend before, everything is so scary, I feel like part of me is just waiting til I fuck up and things go back to normal. It's as though I'm dreaming.
But even with my doubts things are going really well, she's stayed the night, we've met each other's friends and pets and stuff. We even call on each other's lunch breaks.

In the morning I asked if I could take a shower and he said yes and gave me a fresh towel. I went into the bathroom, closed the door and started showering (obvs), but all of a sudden he barged in and started to put on deodorant, fixing his hair etc. At first I didn't notice him coming in, so I jumped a bit and made a little sound when I saw him, but he didn't seem to care. When he left the bathroom he didn't even close the door, he left it a little bit open and went back and forth.

Would you have walked in on a girl showering (that you recently started dating)? I know that people have different views on bathroom privacy, so I'm just interested in hearing if you guys think this is ""normal"" or not.

528,Insane dating standards.,"One of my really good friends (26f) who is pretty average looking, is probably around 5'1(ish), unemployed, absolutely zero hobbies and social life wants a guy who's 6 ft+, making 6 figures, fit, handsome and not only sex but she wants someone to marry her ASAP and she still manages to get people interested in her profile. I'm curious but how is this even remotely normal to expect this when you have the above mentioned credentials.

I told her what I'm looking for:
- Uni educated, preferably in a marketable field with high potential and career oriented (I have a Master's in STEM too)
-Decent(ish) height. I'm 6'2 so I prefer atleast 5'6+
-Not overweight. (I am into badminton/tennis and recently started working out too). I'm just naturally a skinny dude and working out just makes me look even better.

And she joked about how I'd always be alone because I have such high standards. Again I am not even looking for these women online because I know it's never gonna happen. But mostly irl.

Am I crazy for wanting something in a potential partner if I too am accomplished and making good money or possess those characteristics? I do expect women to bring something to the table if I am working my ass off for a brighter career and future and not someone who stays home all day and cooks and cleans.",y1o3np,668,419,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/y1o3np/insane_dating_standards/
529,Am I asking for too much?,"I (29f) was talking to some friends about what I want in a guy. My bare minimum was “have what I have or more, and no kids”. This meaning a car, job, their own place, and no children. Apparently my minimum is asking for too much and I should accept if a man has children.

I don’t understand why I should accept children when I don’t have any. Also I don’t understand what wrong with wanting a man that’s on my level financially (I don’t even make that much) or better. One friend went as far as to tell me this wasn’t realistic. This is literally just being a functioning, self sustaining adult. Is this asking for too much?

Yes I have a car, job, and an apartment to myself. Yes having a car is important where I live.

EDIT:
Hi, thanks for all of your comments. I think I may have confused some by leaving out details that I didn’t think were necessary at the time. I also find it weird that some are considering these things to be qualities instead of things you should have in adulthood and questioning what I bring to the table if I am requesting these things. I already have the bare minimum of what I’m asking a man to have. “Or more” isn’t mandatory. I think some assumed I meant for a man to be a high earner when I used the word more. I didn’t mean for such a simple word to cause such a ruckus. 

 When I said “have their own place” I meant live alone. They don’t need to own a home. I did say I have an apartment so I’m not a home owner. I rent, nothing wrong with renting. Nothing wrong with roommates or living with family. I have my own place that I pay for on my own, I just want a partner who has their own place as well. 

I have a car. It’s a 2009. Nothing fancy about it at all.  It gets me where I need to go. I want a man with their own car. The guy doesn’t need to have a Tesla or a Corvette, just a car. 

I have a regular job. I grossed about $32k last year. I never said I want a man making $500k a year or in the “top 1%”. A regular job that’s the same or more than mine is fine. I make less than middle class so I’m not discriminating against the average guy, I’d actually prefer it.

I don’t have any kids. Children are a big responsibility. There are to many variables to consider when children are involved. If I had kids then I would date a man with kids. 

If a man had the same bare minimum requirement that I did and I didn’t meet that then I would be ok. That means he knows what he’s looking for and I’m not it. That’s perfectly fine. I never mentioned age, physique, looks, qualities, or personalities. Just basic things that I have that I think a man should have if we were to date. Hope this clears some confusion.",rwfh1t,662,487,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rwfh1t/am_i_asking_for_too_much/
530,Condom Use: What is normal?,"
My partner (F22) and I (M26) have been going at it for a couple months now.  I do not enjoy using a condom; it does not feel as good physically and feels less intimate. We both don’t want kids right now (obviously) but she isn’t on birth control. She has said that she is open to looking into female birth control options but then hasn’t looked into it since. I do not want to bring up female birth control again, as I believe that taking medication/inserting a device that fucks with your hormones is only the individuals prerogative, but I’m starting to not want sex. I would rather beat it, get it out of my system, and then just have a relationship without the sex if it means wearing a condom. Is this unusual?

EDIT: I should add that I don’t know how to go about explaining this without hurting her feelings. She wants to have sex and I think would feel rejected if I either A) just stopped being horny because I beat off before getting together or B) explained how I was feeling. I have tried telling her before, but she just said she “didn’t buy that sex doesn’t feel as good for a guy with a condom”.

EDIT2: I appreciate the advice everyone, this got going more than I anticipated. I am thankful that you have shared your experiences and what does/doesn’t work for you; I will take it into consideration and maybe try some different things on my end. 

I know many of you responding think I should be castrated and doomed to the pits of hell because you assumed many parts of my relationship beyond what I shared. I hope that someday you folks can take a step back and maybe think that you don’t know the whole situation and approach an open dialog such as this in a way that is constructive. Not everyone is perfect and everyone has their own hang ups and part of the reason I am here is to get other perspectives and maybe learn something.

And I should add my comment about castration was not in reference to having a vasectomy.. poor choice of word in this context haha.",rg63tx,664,492,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rg63tx/condom_use_what_is_normal/
531,Got rejected by a friend. Now she says she misses me.,"Met a woman last year who I clicked with on many levels at work. We would hang out 1 on 1 whenever I was able to due to my busy schedule but I would text her once or twice a week. Though it started out friendly, I started to be attracted to her. However, I learned after Thanksgiving that she already had a boyfriend. Though I tried to bury the feelings, they wouldn't go away the more we hung out. 

I spoke to a mutual friend about it and he gave me two options: Either ask so that I can get the rejection to help move on or remain cordial at work but go no contact outside of work. After thinking it over, I decided to just take the rejection as it's helped me get over unrequited feelings quickly in the past. 

Last month, she invited myself and her friend group out to a club, however, everyone but I canceled or had other responsibilities, leaving just the two of us. She ended up modifying our plans so that her and I could spend the whole day together. She treated me to a movie that I was looking forward to seeing, hung out at a park, grabbed lunch, and then we went clubbing. At the end of the night, I asked her out and she told me she was seeing someone. I asked her that if this made the friendship awkward, I totally understood her not wanting to continue being friends, however, she said she wanted to stay friends and we went our separate ways.

Since then, I've put up some boundaries for myself to help with moving on. I've focused on my 2022 goals, picked up some new hobbies and some old ones, and spent some time changing my lifestyle. I don't reach out to her to chat anymore. However, since she has me on snapchat, she's been sending me memes of favorite shows or messages me during work asking how I am. I respond cordially but I don't make the same effort to reach out besides sending memes back.

However, I woke up this morning to a message on Snapchat asking me when my next days off will be and that she misses me which raised alarms in my mind. Afterwards, she started asking about the new job I was going to that another mutual friend hooked me up with (that I didn't tell her I got or had the interview for). When I told her I landed the job, she told me we needed to go out and celebrate sometime after I start and how happy she is for me.

I feel like I should trust my gut and brain. I do say I miss my friends, however, I've known my friends for over a decade and don't see them as often due to living in a different city. I also set up boundaries and don't want that work to be trampled on.

I wasn't able to see him during the last week but we were snapping frequently. 

I work a swing shift and while at work, he sent me a snap (a full 1 min length video, not a photo of the ceiling or just a text or something minor, a full length video talking about his day and his thoughts about something) and I was pretty sure he was in his bathroom. I thought, weird, is he GOING to the bathroom while snapping me WHILE I'M AT WORK?! To which he admitted and said it was funny, but I thought it was incredibly gross. I don't even talk on the phone and go to the bathroom, why would you snap while going to the bathroom?!

He says I'm being too uppity and I should just laugh, but... It's just not funny to me, or attractive. It's so gross, and I'm honestly kind of offended he would think I would think it's okay? To me, this communicates : I care so little about how you feel about me or your attraction that I'm going to poop while talking to you.

Last Wednesday was her bday and I took her out. We had a great time and had a deep talk that night, telling each other what we liked about each other etc. 

The next day I leave for a prior planned vacation. That morning she sends me pics of us together w heart eyes and shit. She has her “birthday weekend” where some friends visit. I return and she’s distant from me.

We meet for a talk, she tells me some guy she was talking to for awhile before we met visited her that weekend.

539,"I think it's time to end the ""signals game"" and start normalizing open communication.","I see a lot of post about people getting/giving mixed signals or withholding important opinions, feelings, beliefs, etc. from their loved ones, love interests, or admirers. I don't know when it became commonplace in today's dating world that you are supposed to be keen to all these subtle hints, but personally I feel like it sets up this unhealthy dynamic between two individuals, where not stating your intentions outright when the moment calls for it just serves to cause confusion and misunderstanding.

I am convinced that a lot of these problems that arise from these mental gymnastics could be easily remedied by openly communicating your feelings or expectations once the issue or subject arises, instead of being evasive or misleading with your actions and statements.

If I am interested in someone, I should tell them I am interested. If I am uncomfortable with something that my partner is doing, I should have a talk with them about how and why it makes me uncomfortable. If I am not getting the kind of consenting love language communication that I desire, then I should ask them to reciprocate it.

Things only stand to get exacerbated when the cold shoulder is given, or when feelings are withheld, or intentions not expressed, or others lead on, or hiding things from them, or any other number of passive aggressive communications. But if an open line of communication is kept then there is no confusion on these things.

It can be uncomfortable talking about stuff like relationship expectations, personal rules/boundaries, sexual desires, bringing up issues, etc. with someone that I am interested in, or telling somebody why I am *not* interested in them. But I only think that the reason we feel uncomfortable openly talking about these things is because we as a society have made it that way. I think we need to start normalizing open communication when interacting with others instead of playing head games in hopes that the other person will pick up on the subtle hints.

tl;dr

normalize open communication with others about your feelings and stop passive communication/signaling.",tvbzgc,653,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tvbzgc/i_think_its_time_to_end_the_signals_game_and/

So is it doable? If so, how? Because from where I am it feels like I'll be alone forever and a relationship is just a fairy tale fantasy that will never happen.",x4m0fk,626,427,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/x4m0fk/how_do_you_attract_women_as_a_low_energy_guy_29m/
548,Should I be concerned if the guy I just started to date is on onlyfans?,"Totally get that we aren’t attached or in a relationship so he can do as he pleases. I also like that he was open to me about it. But does this mean he will be on onlyfans if we got into a relationship?

Edit: he is on onlyfans paying for personalized porn content, not making it.

Edit2: if he were my bf, I’d be fine with him watching regular porn. But onlyfans porn involves interacting with the content creator and that seems to cross the line if we were in a relationship. Again, he’s free to do what he wants now as we are just regular dating.",z7z83a,627,449,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/z7z83a/should_i_be_concerned_if_the_guy_i_just_started/
549,Dating app dates are so boring,"I’ve been on a few tinder / bumble / hinge dates this month and all of them have been terrible! These girls have the personality of a wet sock. 

For example, one of my dates was a walk in the park, her idea. We’re chatting and she asks me about my hobbies. I tell her about them and she seems not interested, so I ask her about her hobbies because people love talking about themselves. She then says her hobbies were tiktok Twitter and Snapchat. I literally had no clue what to do from there.

Another date barely talked at all, I didn’t know if she was uncomfortable or if I just wasn’t her type but then after the date *she* suggested we do it again, then ghosted me. 

Anyway I have barely any way to meet women irl but this dating app thing is super stupid and I’m about to give up on dating. It took a whole month to get three dates and they were so boring I almost decided to leave early. :(",syd4c3,630,206,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/syd4c3/dating_app_dates_are_so_boring/

I'm certain that isn't normal or appropriate and makes me terrified to ever invite anyone to my home ever again.

552,"Pls help, is this cute, or a red flag?!","So I (f21) met this guy (m23) the other day on bumble. His profile says that he isn’t sure what he’s looking for, whereas mine says that I want a relationship. When we hung out, I found out that he hasn’t been in a serious relationship in a few years, and his one and only lasted 3 months. Also, he’s a real sweet talker, and says such adorable things. 

Anyway the convo continues and I mention how if I were to get into a relationship, I’d want to take things slowly (and that since this was our first encounter, I’m not down to kiss him). He says that he’s completely on board and wants to get to know me too. However, he asks if he can hold my hand. At the time, I thought it was super cute, and I says for sure. He also said how he likes how I told him we can’t kiss because it makes it so much hotter (not going to lie, I found that so sexy haha). 

I’ve told a couple of friends of our encounter, and one said that what he did was nothing is unusual. However, my other friend emphasized how despite my asking to take things slowly, he disregarded what I said and even though it would only be a kiss, he moved somewhat aggressively (the taking my hand and tease talking). 

I can’t decide whether what he was just very bold and blunt or if this is a red flag. Please help a girl out and let me know what you think !

tldr: is it a red flag that I (f21) want to take things slowly with a guy (m23) I had just met, but despite his verbal agreement, he still is extremely forward and bold/blunt in his actions.

553,(24M) slept with a Lesbian best friend (24F) as her first male partner.,"We've been good friends for a few months and during some one on one quality time she was talking about how weird it is that she wants to spend so much time with a guy though she's never enjoyed being around men her whole life. She asked me my thoughts on it and I told her I wouldn't know how to put it to words, but that I'd love to hear her thoughts on it.

After she said some stuff, I kind of called myself a straight femboy and she agreed, told me she feels comfortable around me because as a guy I'm always willing to give up my position to resolve conflict, and that in all her time knowing me I've never seemed angry no matter how stressed. She says I'm more gentle than most women she's dated and that if I were a woman I'd succeed in this world instantly. She continued to just giggly tell me a lot of sweet things.

Then she got all flustered and embarrassed after that I thanked her by telling her sweet things back about her; we hugged for a while, and she kissed me on the cheek...  Afterwards she looked me in the eyes with the most passionate stare I've ever seen, then kissed me on the lips, then after an hour of romantic sweet talking and gentle kissing we slept together.

Where do I go from here? As the first male she's found interest in should I not expect anything but maybe be something that she can explore? We both seem happy with what's been happening and where things could go. I'm not expecting anything though.

***Edit for those calling her toxic because of my word choice*** I'm not a man of conflict, I try to see the world from the perspective that I'm probably wrong. I'm pretty good at elaborating my points though to show why I believe what I believe in hopes that I've been understanding things properly, but I'm very much a ""well doesn't this mean this?"" If not ""oh, so you're saying it actually means this?"" and I am always willing to accept that change in thought. But I'm sure there are some things I could get angry about, but far too few for me to recognize them. I've kind of always believed the less things you have to be mad about, the more seriously people will take you when you do get mad. So again, please don't think of her as toxic because I'm failing to properly express 3 hours of convo into a 4 ""paragraph"" post. (But by no standards a college level paragraph). 

BTW I hope you all have a wonderful day ❤️",w9wdsp,619,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/w9wdsp/24m_slept_with_a_lesbian_best_friend_24f_as_her/

I am a true believer that a man’s treatment of you is a reflection of how he feels about you (OBVIOUSLY). But I’m still curious if any men give late replies on purpose, to avoid looking clingy.

558,OLD - People say hookups are ruining dating..i say the culture of ‘indifference’ is.,"I hate that a lot of the time you can’t be genuinely excited to talk to someone anymore. If you exhibit signs of interest, to some people it just translates as being needy. There is so much mental bullshit that comes with doing things. I can’t just be on my phone during a break at work and message a girl back because it ‘hasn’t been long enough’ since she last messaged (or i last messaged) and apparently that’s needy too and it seems like you have no life. So you have to artificially create this timing because messaging too soon means that you’re desperate with nothing else going on in your life. When in actuality i just have 5 minutes to spare to write something. Overly complicated mental work. 

Everyone i match with is so inundated with choices and it just feels like an exhausting competition of who can care the least so that when ghosting inevitably happens, they won’t be hurt as they’ve invested nothing. So much dating advice on this sub and otherwise echoes this sentiment. I’m not saying i want to marry a girl 2 days after messaging, but I just want to be able to give a shit. It’s so uncool to just be yourself when so many people adhere to what is ‘normal’ and ‘standard’ behavior. I want to put a less ranty, more eloquently put version of this on my profiles to find people who feel the same way, but even that comes across as bitter, woman hating etc and is unattractive. I want someone real, who doesn’t give a shit and isn’t scared to feel something. Dating is hard and feelings are always on the line…yes, that means you can get hurt. It had always been this way but OLD created a gross, mutated cultural way of thinking

I’m not just some bitter guy who never gets dates or hasn’t touched a girl…this is an observation over the years of using OLD on and off. And before people say get off the apps, it’s not exactly easy for some people to meet others organically in their life with certain jobs and lifestyle.",rqjceg,618,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rqjceg/old_people_say_hookups_are_ruining_datingi_say/

I (26F) was in a store talking to a male staff member. We were having a pleasant chat and I thought he was cute.

Some people asked for an update which I initially
forgot to do…

Update is we’ve had 2 dates and have kind of hit it off I think? He’s a sweet dude and we have a similar weird sense of humour. He is very affectionate whereas I have trouble showing affection (I’ve been told I send mixed signals) so when we hang next I’m going to make sure i tell him I’ve enjoyed spending time with him.

560,The girl(19) I (22m) am dating wants to wait to have sex.,"
We were dating for 1 month, she told me she wants to wait till we know eachother more. She also told me that the guys before me wanted her only for sex.

 I like everything about her and she feels the same about me. So I'm not going to pump and dump her.

 Anyway, even though I'm open to waiting, I rather wait 2 months than 6 months.

So...  Since the reason she wants to wait is that the other guys wanted her only for sex:

1 )Is there something I can do to make her feel more comfortable about having sex?

2) What are some ways to show her my commitment?

If there's nothing I can do, I'm just gonna wait.

He will go silent in the middle of a conversation and then hours and hours later say “Hey, how’s your evening?” as if he didn’t just disappear for 8 hours.

I gave it to him and we have been texting for the last 2 weeks and added each other on fb.

Dates are fun and full of laughter and we slowly starting learning more about each other as it’s supposed to go. However, outside of that, I could barely get a hold on this guy. For context, he initially pursued me and I wasn’t all that interested tbh but he asked me to hang out and I gave him a chance. Long story short, I grew to see him as a potential partner. 

By our third (and final) date, I found myself mostly initiating our conversations. When he would respond, I would follow up and then not hear from him for days. The very few times he would start a convo, I would still be left on read.

When I questioned him, he said that his work takes a toll on him and he gets super busy and doesn’t have the time or energy to text back. I would be ok with this except for the fact that I see him active on this dating app we met on every night. 

So I called him out on it thru text and he didn’t really acknowledge it. And so I parted ways with him at that point.

568,"Men, know your value and don’t settle for bullshit drama","I (36/M) was dating for about 3 months a 33/F I met through a work connection. We were doing and saying a lot of things with each other that would suggest everything short of being in a relationship. We had little pet names and would text each other throughout the day just to tease. 

One month in, we even went on this amazing road trip together where we both had a great time and good conversation. There was a lot of communication but not really substantive communication which is so important to see where you are mentally and in life. I really wanted to get that kind of communication so that things could progress to where I intended things to go. I’m a patient person and so I want to give a potential SO the space to make their own decision with time. I know what signs I’m looking for when I know it’s a good time for the relationship to progress to something official but at the end of 2 months, I asked if we could make things official and was denied with nothing that explained what she needed or was looking for. She just wanted to see where things would go. 

Another month goes by and had some quality dates… or so I thought. In my opinion, there wasn’t anything that should be holding things back at this point. There was one date night when we went to go see the Ghostbusters movie together that something was just off because she sat at the bar waiting for me and didn’t pull up a chair for me or really give me much room at the end of the bar. It was STRANGE. I played it off and tested her during the movie when she was pointing away from me and so I leaned in for a kiss. That’s when she pulled away and I was like WTF. I didn’t react at all after that but I did text her what was up and she had some bullshit answer about how she wasn’t feeling it and just wanted to be alone. I was like…. Well okay, I guess then we are done right? And she was just giving me these non-answers, so I just figured, you know what? Fuck this noise. I’m done. I didn’t contact her after all of that and she started trying to talk with me and get my attention again on text. I’m gone. I have totally just lost complete attraction for her. I remained cordial and nice throughout my phase-out despite maybe my tone here in this post but it was really one of the most weird situations I’ve experienced. 

Look, I’m 36 and I’m trying to best use of my time (maybe some other men my age read this) with the best woman I can find who really pays the same level of attention that I’m paying to them. I know eventually I’ll find this person but in the meantime, let me just share my experience with you guys that this is an example of what I did and I feel like I dodged a bullet.

570,To men from a women: 20 things to help make a successful dating profile (in no particular order),"1 Craft beer gym gym adventure travel outdoors gym craft beer tattoo motorcycle gym craft beer... An astonishing number of profiles all include these buzz words in the bio. But these things rarely truly define you.  Instead try to focus on the things about you that make you unique!

2 Related to the above, often these things can be expressed in a picture rather than in your bio. You with an animal, showing a tattoo, or at the gym are self explanatory, and basically say nothing about you if it's in your bio.

3 Pictures to avoid, could be considered cliche or are overused / common:
- you in the gym. If you have photos where you're fit, then it's a pretty obvious indicator
- you in the gym in general
- Selfie in your car, especially with sun glasses dear god
- low quality pics (blurry, grainy, etc)
- more than one with you and another person
- artsy pics, like heavy filters, dark shadows, or other ones that obscure your face
- your abs as the main pic
- you showing your abs with a selfie in the bathroom
- several with the same facial expression, especially a goofy one
- pics that don't show your face, such a in a helmet or mask, unless you've got a reason for anonymity
- more than one in sunglasses
- no pics at all

4 If you want to attract a long term relationship and ever want kids, then you can include one in your pics. If you're looking for a hook up, leave them out.

5 If you feel like you have to explain a person in your photos, leave them out too.

6 If you're looking as part of a couple, include them in your main pic, have a picture of just them as well, and follow the rules in this list.

7 Unless you're #6, try to avoid include someone else in your main pic.

8 Pictures that would show your many facets and provide a complete view into the real you, in order of priority:
- main pic, your face
- full body dressed up (at least a collared shirt) that is NOT a selfie
- action pic, like doing a kick flip, you up on stage singing kareoke, you casting a rod, or playing a board game (preferably not a selfie
- full body in any setting 

9 Additional pic suggestions:
- other pics of you doing things that you really enjoy or help express who you are and what makes you unique
- at least 20% that are NOT selfies
-  if you want to show you're physically fit, do so in a setting that you'd normally be shirtless, like at the pool or while hiking. Use the pic to show both your body and give a little bit more about you
- try to have every pic tell something about yourself. Pics of you with no context are wasted and more than one isn't helpful or attractive
- include at least 4 pics, including the 3 listed above
- animal or pet pictures are fine, but only with you in them and visible (not just your lap for example)

10 Have a bio! Tags are fine, but keep in mind that 10000 other people have the same damn tags. And if you have it in a tag you don't need it in your bio, and visa versa

11 Bio suggestions in no particular order:
- say what you are looking for in a partner (needs to like camping, likes to stay home / go out, enjoys anime. This both helps a partner know if they'd be a good fit as well as tell a little bit more about you
~~- be explicit about deal breakers (no conservatives, no tattoos, no cats). Don't waste anyone's time~~
- avoid things like 'message me and find out'
- avoid anything that doesn't give any information, like 'lets see what happens', or simply nothing that says anything about you or what you're looking for
- say concisely what type of relationship you're looking for, like hook up, long term, friends, or a combination. Don't go on like 'looking for someone to chill with' or 'in town for a few days'
- say if you have a kid
- we don't care about how you feel, what your status is on your dating scene, or why you're even here. Things like: new to this stuff, just out of a relationship, don't really like this sort of thing, i hate online dating, just out of a long term relationship
- if you have a pic with a pet, don't also put it in your bio unless it's a deal breaker
- don't talk about race. Ethnicity or culture is fine, but best only if it's really integral to who you are or would make a difference in the type of partner you're looking for. Try to avoid things like from the UK or just got back from China
- it doesn't matter if you've been previously married
- unless your vaccination status is a deal breaker or you're opposed to it, don't include it in your bio
- if you speak another language or have a language you prefer, say something in that language. Don't put 'speaks French'
- avoid listing your faults

12 To avoid confusion, don't put your school unless you're in school

13 If you are self employed, have a business, or don't have a clear job title, put something descriptive like free lance photography or created candle business

14 If you a super broad job like artist, add what kind of artist or other info that provides insight. Like others in this list, if it doesn't say something useful then you're wasting time and space

15 Be specific whenever possible. Don't put outdoors, put camping or hiking. Don't put tech, put programmer or Internet of things

16 If someone states what they want in their bio, dear god don't match if you don't qualify. If you do match those characteristic, it shows your genuine interest if you tell us what about you does match

17 Start the conversation with what made you interested in me or a question to learn more about something in the profile. Don't say hey how's it going. we've already started the conversation by matching, so skip the salutations and get right to what has value 

~~18. If you match, don't message them until you're available to have a conversation~~

19 Unlike texting, it's a good idea to let your match know when you have to step away from a conversation. It shows respect and prevents the 'oh they don't like me' worry

20 Check out r/neckbeardthings to learn what's cringe and then avoid those things (things like saying m'lady, etc)

Edit 2: it might be helpful to add context to this list, which is also in a comment. My brother is the most wonderful person in the whole fkn world. He's sweet, honest, and loyal. He has a fantastic sense of humor. He's even fairly good looking. But never gets matches. He feels like it's his fault and that he's inadequate and a failure. It couldn't be farther from the truth, but without matches what else is he supposed to think?

The only reason I got in tinder was to help him with his profile. The points i made were what i observed. He had no idea that every other profile mentioned the gym. That they all have a selfie in your car. That they all said adventure. But it's not that all these men were the same, it's that they all felt like what they were saying was what society and women wanted. 

People deserve better. We've got to support men to not be afraid of being themselves. Like everyone, they deserve to feel safe to express themselves. Because the reality is most women appreciate that, and find it attractive. And the women who don't aren't worth your time anyway. Unfortunately upper society has set ludacris standards and that's what we constantly hear.

It's not true. It's not real. And after helping him he started getting regular matches. So i helped some friends. And now I'm genuinely just trying to others.

571,"UPDATE: Inquired a few weeks ago about asking a women out at the gym. Details in post, including original.","Original post:

I (29M) have noticed a women at my gym who appears to be looking at me more than usual. I find her quite attractive and have wanted to break the ice to start a conversation.. but I have always thought the gym an inappropriate place to do that for a number of reasons (don’t want to interrupt, it’s personal time/space, etc). 

My question is kind of a two parter - 1. is it ever appropriate, and 2. If so, should I just ask for her number to talk later, or would it be better to make small talk there first?

Apologies if this is long winded but I appreciate any thoughtful incite. Thank you!

UPDATE:

Okay, so it’s been a hot minute since this post. We started chatting in person a couple days after posting, long story short she is coming over for a home cooked meal and our first date this weekend. Thanks for the well wishes and support everyone!

End of the day what seemed to work was stealing a few smiles before asking about some crazy back workout she was doing. That was the ice breaker, started making small talk until yesterday when I got her number and asked her on a date.

SECOND UPDATE: okay this was done in a post as well as on here, not sure how this normally works. 

Well as promised I am writing an update following the date. I am a Reddit noob and have never done a multi update post, sorry if the format is poor.

Date was phenomenal. We had incredible chemistry, initial awkwardness was very short-lived as we got to know one another better. 

I made us butter chicken for dinner, she brought some baked goods for dessert. Things got heated but we agreed to mostly keep the clothes on and not rush anything. She will be coming back over in a few days.

I’m an awkward guy, and it is not often that a date feels this organic. Thank you very much everyone for the support and help leading up to this - r/dating-advice y’all are the MVPs of my weekend.

574,Girl cancelled date because she wanted to go home and workout. What is the worst excuse you’ve received?,"Been chatting with this girl on bumble for a week. She confirmed the date and time we were to meet earlier in the day. Then a few hours before the date she tells me she wants to go home and workout and asks to reschedule. 

I’m not sure if I respect the excuse or if I’m appalled at the lack of effort of it. What’s the worst excuse you’ve ever gotten for a cancelled date?

Edit: For more context this was planned a week ago because it was the first day I had free. I gave her an out on the day of asking to confirm which she did. 

She can cancel for whatever reason but to workout shows me a lack of interest and lack of respect for my time. She doesn’t owe me her time and I don’t owe her any more of my time and effort. I had unmatched after.

Edit 2: I appreciate all the responses. I posted this to see if other people have got this excuse because I’ve heard some in my day. This particular woman I unmatched with before I even posted this. It caused quite the debate. At 36 with a 7 year old (she is 42) with other options I don’t really have the time for someone like this. It really was just about cancelling after confirming. Had she said initially said it’s not going to work today that would be totally fine. I felt like I gave her an out if she wanted it. But since she confirmed it I feel a better excuse was needed. I don’t have that much free time and maybe she does so it was no big deal. I think I would have appreciated a lie. At least that’s some effort into a story. 😂. But if you haven’t heard that excuse before now you have.

Thank you all for giving me things to think about and how I can better handle something like this in the future.",sq1gxq,600,303,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sq1gxq/girl_cancelled_date_because_she_wanted_to_go_home/

Welp I was able to find her on Instagram (she has a pretty unique name) and her profile is public with very recent pictures of her + her fiancé. 

I’m not sure what to do, I haven’t actually met this girl in person yet but I feel like I should reach out to her fiancé (he is tagged in her IG pics)? Or should I just delete her and stay out of it?

Edit: Really appreciate all the comments, going to try and get more info from her before reaching out to him but can post an update if enough people care. Want to make sure there’s not something about this that I’m missing first.

Update: well this got more traction than I was expecting so here is the update. I asked her if she is in a relationship and she deleted me…think that pretty much answers everyone’s questions. I am pretty much certain it is not a fake profile like some were suggesting. She said she recently moved to my city for work so my guess is she’s here without her fiancé rn.

577,Am I Doing This Right? Am I Ready?,"When my wife passed, I didn’t cry. I didn’t throw my anger in fistfuls through the walls, nor did I destroy the various monitors that had decided she was gone. My hand wandered to hers, as it had on the walk home from our first date. As it had when she first moved in with me and I reached for a box to help her. As it had when we washed dishes together, suds to our elbows. My hand wandered to hers as it had when I tried yoga with her and couldn’t stand up afterwards. As it had when her father passed and I tried to still the trembling. As it had when I slipped a silver ring upon her finger. My hand wandered to hers as it had when a priest recognized our Union. As it had when the universe granted us a gift to arrive on my birthday. As it had when I helped her paint a nursery that wasn’t to be used.

There’s a cruel secret the universe will never tell you. A secret we scoff at to suggest it’s common knowledge. Yet it’s a secret you only learn once you can’t do it again; each time a hand rests in another’s, that moment becomes part of your identity.

When my hand wandered to hers, that moment became me. Her hand was frigid, but not like the times she would shove her fingers under my thighs. Her fingers were stiff, but not like the times she pointed at the dog. Her color was gone, but not like the days after each chemo session.

And all three became me as I fell into a cold colorless cocoon.

I will not speak of progress, nor growth, nor understanding. I believe you’ve to be alive to feel those things. Yet, just tonight, I felt springtime. I decided to meet with a woman my sister in law set up. We chatted over little things such as toys we always wanted. Or when gas was two digits. Or when we each had our first Christmas away from home. As my head bowed, and my voice vanished, she reached across the table. Her fingers traced over my wedding ring then turned my hand to rest atop hers. While her hand vanished, the weight of mine did so as well. 

Silently, I took a break from isolation.

Anyways, I’m absolutely mortified and cried my face off when he left. He did not address it and he was still very sweet all morning and still spooned me.

580,"Ladies, trust those instincts!","I just wanted to share this story to remind everyone that your gut instincts are there for a reason and a women’s intuition is no joke. So, I (26 f), have been seeing this guy (m 30) for a few weeks. We both live in a big city now but actually grew up in the same area a few hours outside of this city. When we first met, I was very enamored with him. We had a lot in common, he knew what compliments to give me, he was very attractive, and we had a lot of chemistry. 

We continue to see each other but around date 2 I start to get a gut feeling that something is just off and I just couldn’t put my finger on it, since he was a gentleman and we got along great. Well fast forward to date 5 or 6, and he mentioned something in passing about legal trouble and having a lot on his mind, etc. Now, I am not one to judge at all and am very tolerant of others but considering that I have continued to have this unshakable feeling that he was not being honest about something, I look him up.
Not only has this man been in and out of jail for non-violent crimes, but within the last year he was arrested for domestic violence with his past partner, the details I will spare, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon AND has two restraining orders against him from women.
So, anyways, trust your instincts and remember that people are on their best behavior at the very beginning.

She also owns various books on dating men as a woman etc. I'm all for feminism but I'm not sure if I'm feeling more R/FDS vibes here. Is this a common thing for women? She mentioned how part of it is based off her own experienced with dating men, and I've experienced a lot of bad stuff with women. From being stabbed, sexually assaulted and harassed, but that's just bad experiences and bad people, right? I don't hate the entire gender. 


And she finished it off with something about being angry that she's straight, and not gay so she could avoid men completely. Not once before this did i get any kind of those vibes. She's extremely intelligent and has a great career, much better than my own. And has been great to talk to every day, and I was excited to meet her.

589,What's something you've learned while dating?,"For me it's: women are in the moment creatures. You have to strike while the iron is hot.

If you go on a date with a woman, and she likes you, she usually gives you a small window of time. Usually it's a couple of dates, and it's your job as a man to drive it in a romantic direction.

If you treat her like a platonic buddy on those dates, her interest will plummet and it's game over.

You have to make moves. I think that's the reason why sex on the third date is such a cliche because you only have a small window to lock it down. I also think women don't really look at men romantically until things get sexual.

The best analogy I can give is: it's like building a fire. If you throw a log on the flame too quickly it'll smother it and burn out (don't shove your tongue down her throat pawing away at her the first 10 minutes you meet her). Yet at the same time if you never feed the fire at all, it'll burn out (going on multiple dates without doing anything).

So read the room, respect the window of time, and strike when the iron is hot.

A little more background to the situation. I went on 3 dates with a girl last month that in my opinion went pretty well. It seemed like we enjoyed each other’s company and things were going smooth. We even made out after every date that we’ve had. At the end of our last date she then asks when she’ll see me again. Then before I answer she says actually wait I’ll have to let you know because im getting pretty busy. That’s all fine so I told her I would hit with plans in the next few days and she was fine with that. I then hit her with plans a few days later and she then tells me she’s busy and that’s okay. I then ask when she’ll be free again so we can work something out and then she proceeds to ghost. At this point it definitely took a mental toll because she’s the 3rd girl to do this to me within the last few months and it’s making me feel terrible lol.",vbh25x,579,373,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vbh25x/why_is_ghosting_so_relevant_in_dating/

594,Lied about my age,"Hi people, 21M here. In a sticky situation with a 26F. I met this girl on Instagram a couple weeks back and to cut things short we ended up going on a date, she picked me up from a side road outside town where I left my truck as she had free parking in town and insisted on picking me up (I’m guessing just to suss me out)

Anyway, when I got in conversation was flying I was thinking what a good start, she was gorgeous, funny and seemed to have a good thing going for her. Next thing she asks is my age, now I’m a big bastard and don’t look or act my age in anyway, so I said you first. 26… perfect always preferred older so I just straight up said I’m 21 (I Am). Now when I say the look on her face was as if someone had just crashed into her car I mean she literally looked more guilty than a crack dealer getting picked up by old bill with the crack in hand. 

Obviously seeing her reaction I straight away said I was joking and that I was 23. That was an “acceptable” age to her and we eventually spoke about how 21 would be too young. Had a great date everything went well, I’ve seen her a few times since, really enjoyed each other’s company and have even booked events a month in advance together, every time we meet though somehow age has come into it and she insists that 21 is just too young for her. Obviously with me sinking into my seat I can’t bring myself to tell her. Chances are she might not care as she’s said that I don’t act my age anyway (thinking I’m 23). Now obviously if things go the distance this lie has to stop but I don’t want it to end just yet if it comes to it. What’s the best move?

TIA

Edit - after comments I’ll be coming clean the next time I see her and trying to apologise for the lie. Also try to convince her to see past it thanks for the help

During our date, we are touching. I'm talking about holding hands, shoulders brushing, the tame rated E stuff, not trying to clean her tonsils with my tongue in the middle of downtown. I did go for a peck on the cheek but she dodged so I didn't try that again. Doesn't mention anything about being uncomfortable. At drop off, said she had a great time and agreed to a second date. Get home and she hits me with ""it isn't going to work because you don't respect my boundaries."" Wtf? She did some stuff that while they don't necessarily cross a boundary, I thought was kinda rude or inconsiderate  but I just let it slide because hey, it's not a huge deal. Was almost 30 mins late at pick up, when she did show up brought a bookbag with her and said she was going to study DURING OUR DATE (ending up watching her study for 2.5 hours of our date), and she wasn't going to tip our waitress because the service wasn't phenomenal (service was perfectly fine, I have zero complaints) and ""they just bring out food"". I understand that people have boundaries but every boundary can't be a ""one mistake and we're done"" boundary. I'm only human. Humans are flawed and make mistakes.

Not a trimmed 5 o’clock shadow situation, and not a full beard. Just a weird bushy in-between (read: not groomed, unkempt, patchy, messy). It makes swiping hard, because it’s all I can see after so many profiles. 

I’m worried I might be passing up a genuinely great guy over facial hair. But then… do I want to date someone who doesn’t know what a trimmer is?

604,"If you have to self-edit or second guess your behavior to hold someone’s attention, move on. Don’t rely on mind games or tactics to maintain attraction.","There is still an abundance of Pick Up Artist tactics being pushed out there, but being re-branded as inner game advice.

One example is the concept of Push-Pull (i.e. going hot and cold with emotions) by being ‘authentic’.  This is utterly contradictory advice and thinly veiled manipulation, in the guise of self-determination. You can disagree with her, be independent, not be too available—but if at the core of this behavior, you are trying to create a certain hot-cold dynamic, you aren’t being authentic at all. In fact, you’re being manipulative and weak.

Keep things simple. If you want to be in a relationship with someone, you need the freedom to be yourself entirely, be comfortable around them, and not rely on withdrawal of yourself intentionally or establishing boundaries solely for the sake of appearing bold to hold their interest. Being truly busy and holding to your obligations will take care of everything. If you are modifying your baseline behavior for the sake of creating a dynamic in your relationship, it’s not authentic.

If you want to text or talk to them, text them. If you want to see them, reach out to them. Just don’t be overbearing and insecure. No need to analyze a next step to get a reaction, have the
emotional freedom to act how you want. If you can’t be yourself without them losing interest, they don’t have a high level attraction to begin with.

-Make physical activity a priority. Sports, martial arts, lifting, etc.

-Make time to maintain your current friendships, particularly with men. 

-Make time for learning and self-development

-Maintain and develop your current career

617,I Got Catfished; How Do I Politely Reject Her?,"I (23M) just got done with a date that I matched with on Bumble and I feel rather disappointed. She (21F) and I met at a local diner and she looked practically nothing like she did in her profile pictures. Seriously, I could barely tell if the pictures and the woman I saw in real life was the same person (besides her hair color & height). On her profile, she looked rather pretty and captivating (and I was actually pretty nervous about meeting her because of this).

However, when I saw her walk up to the table I got for us at a local diner, I was rather dismayed & miffed at the mismatch in her appearance. Her complexion wasn't the same and she didn't nearly have the same figure as depicted in her pictures. And even though I decided to wear dress shoes so as to make a good first impression, she chose to wear flip-flops like the ones you would wear in public showers to avoid a foot fungus, not stylish ones (and I know it wasn't due to financial reasons, or else I wouldn't have cared).

So in an innocuous way (I don't think she caught my intent), I commented on a particular feature in one of her pictures and asked how old it was. She said it was ""3 years-old."" I smiled and continued on with the conversation in a casual way, but I was displeased with her answer. I made sure all of my pictures were less than a year old and that they matched what you see in real life as much as possible, but apparently the same courtesy wasn't returned. I never brought the topic up to her though because I didn't want to be a dick and make her feel like s\*\*t for how she looked. So I was nice and made sure we both had as good a time as you can have with a brunch date, but I also didn't explicitly ask for a second date by the time she had to go.

The issue I'm running into now is that I've never full-blown rejected a woman before. I know that may come as a shock to some, but I have always been the one to be rejected, and practicing the enforcement of self-made standards in the dating world is kind of new to me. She told me that she struggles with both depression, social anxiety, and had just gotten out of a 2.5-year relationship (that she ended). With that in mind, how on Earth do I politely turn her down without coming across as a jerk and completely destroying her self-confidence? I know what rejection feels like and how it can bring you down into the slumps, and I guess my empathetic side doesn't want her to go through that. But at the same time, I don't want to date her and I think ghosting is the coward's way out, so any advice is definitely appreciated. Even word-for-word examples would be helpful if you have any. Thanks.

However, the other day he says to me that he IS in fact a virgin and when I asked him why he lied to me about it, he said he didn’t want me to think that he didn’t know his stuff (?)

On multiple occasions when we were intimate virtually or in person, I always told him how I wasn’t experienced and may not always know what to do, etc. (basically was very candid with my sexual life since day 1). 

I don’t understand why he felt like he should lie about it because it’s not like I am experienced in this area? And he has known that me as a person would never judge him based on him being a virgin or not. 

I am not sure if this is a red flag, or an issue I should be upset about? Because he did lie to me about things and kept the lie going even though he had 1. No reason to lie in the first place and 2. Multiple occasions to be honest with me about it. 

I’d like to know how I can approach this issue? Or should I just let it go since it’s no big deal?

Edit : I read every comment and advice shared, I did decide to let this go, since I understand what an insecurity it is for the guys out there (I didn’t think much into it till now, but god it must suck!)

622,Rule 1 in the wake of recent SCOTUS news,"Good afternoon, folks.

Our stance is that we support women and their reproductive rights. You might, for one reason or another, feel differently about the subject. Several users, to put it mildly, have used this news of the leaked draft to be utterly and unacceptably sexist. That will result in an immediate and permanent ban.

625,"Two weeks ago, y’all hyped me up to ask a guy out for the first time in my life. I have an update and this whole experience has changed my life.","Update time: Yup, had a crush, had a lifetime of intense social anxiety in my back pocket, and I’ve had a wild two and a half months over this whole thing. It pretty much totally consumed me and it’s taught me a hell of a lot about myself that I think other people could benefit from hearing.

Here’s the original post’s text:

Please hype me up. Shooting my shot for the first time in my life in a couple days.

So yeah, I (21F) have arrived at the end of a two month long crush that’s occupied all of my brain space. Ready to end it by asking him out. I have pretty crippling social anxiety (have my whole life, just a few years ago I couldn’t go into a store alone but I’ve come a hell of a long way since) so this is an especially out of character risk I’m taking.

We’ve talked a handful of times, most of which he initiated, and I just really like him. Figure I just need to know. Think I’m finally sick of spending years wondering if my crushes liked me back all along. 

I keep having to remind myself that it’s a totally normal thing to do and hell, people should ask each other out more often. And I think it could be really good for me to face this, almost especially if I get rejected. It’s still all kinds of terrifying though.

Hype of any sorts or similar stories would be greatly appreciated :) wish me luck getting through it no matter what happens

UPDATE: Yes, still fully planning on doing this but a few days later than I thought I’d be able to. These comments are all awesome and doing so much for my confidence going into this. Really appreciate the encouragement and I’ll be sure to update this once I’ve actually gone through with it to celebrate regardless of the outcome :)


REAL UPDATE: Soooo…..I did it. Straight used the big girl words “do you maybe wanna go out with me sometime? Like to get coffee or something?”. I think my soul left my body because I don’t even remember trying to say it, it just sort of came out once I got him alone. 

He said yes.

And that’s awesome. But hell, who knows where this goes from here? Even if the date sucks, the journey was totally worth it. It felt so simple once I got all the words out and I know your kind words helped in some capacity to get me to that point. Thanks for the hype Reddit :)



SO, that was the original post. I’ll be forever grateful to everyone who left such awesome encouraging comments on that post and told me that they really respected my outlook, confidence and choice to push myself outside of my comfort zone.

But.

I couldn’t get this thought out of my head after he said yes that it was all too good to be true and that he’d be texting me to cancel any second. I knew that was my brain’s stupid way of protecting me but I let myself be a little hesitant since he could’ve easily been going in with a sort of “why not” stance and if he still didn’t feel the same after our date, it could all end there. Couldn’t get my hopes up too high.

An hour before the date, he calls to say he’s sick and really sorry but says we could still do the date if I wanted to. Obviously I said we shouldn’t and he said we could reschedule on Monday during our shared class if he was feeling better then. We did sort of settle on Tuesday (tomorrow) during this conversation which gave me some faith that he wasn’t lying to me.

Still, again, the demon voice in my head telling me that he was gonna keep lying to me to get out of going on the date was keeping me really depressed. I could’ve dealt with him turning me down when I asked him out because hey, I’d rehearsed it in my brain a million times. I never rehearsed me disliking him a little because he was a liar. I’d much rather be sad than have my crush sort of dissolve altogether. (Keep in mind, I’m totally aware, especially looking back, at how much emotional bias I had here. Me preparing for something wrong meant that the second something did go wrong, I tricked myself into thinking it was always gonna go that way. Unfortunately, really awful timing exists. Things happen.)

I talked myself through our history again and realized that everything up to that point legitimately made more sense if he really liked me back and was serious about going on the date. So I let myself have some hope while I still could and just be happy.

Cut to today, Monday. I’m sure you see where it’s going, but he was really very nice. Thankfully he didn’t try to say he was busy again or still sick. Told me he’d “found some stuff out” recently and with that plus having been sick, he’s been going through a lot and isn’t in a dating place right now and needs to learn how to be single. Now I’m not one to assume. It’s unnecessary. But I’ve landed at this: even if it’s a lie, he said it in the nicest way. [EDIT: I realize how much I just made it sound like I think it’s super unlikely that he’s being honest but I can totally imagine some situations where this would all be true. Makes a ton of sense and sometimes you just have to choose to trust people.] Gave me a hug at the end and kept apologizing. It’s definitely some kind of comfort that he seems like he does really respect and like me so he doesn’t want to hurt me. That’s worth something on its own in a platonic way.

But uh, wow. When I tell you that this crush changed my life, it’s an understatement. I made a whole event out of this. After all, the first time I started considering asking him out, I had that “ahhhh holy shit are you serious? Have you met you?” going in the back of my head. I have some little notes entries and voice memos I made documenting my rollercoaster of a thought process throughout this whole thing and I’m really thankful that I did that. 

I was riding a genuine confidence high once a couple hours had passed after he turned me down. Obviously I couldn’t be fine and happy right away. Felt my bones go cold when he started talking and thought I might cry but never really came close. I’m still in a great place with it but definitely feeling the natural disappointment.

But here’s my advice to anyone with a crush, especially if the idea of letting them know you like them scares you:

Holy shit, do it. Please.

Don’t rush into it. But you have no idea how much you can learn about yourself. How easily you can teach yourself to cut out all the bullshit you put yourself through out of fear of what people might think on a daily basis. My whole brain feels lighter now. And I’m oddly excited to have to be around someone who’s rejected me. Think I’ll be more relaxed in public than I’ve been in years. 

Because I know that I did something brave as hell and I’m better for it. 

Thanks again for all the support. This is a happier ending than it sounds like, truly.

627,Why are there so many men who don’t dress nicely for a first date?,"I’ve been on many dates where I put effort into looking cute and presentable given it will be a first impression that I care about. However, so many times men (late 20s, early-mid 30s) will show up looking grungy and dirty. Wearing athletic (not fashion) sneakers, dirty crumpled shirts, unkempt hair etc. and it’s so disappointing. Always makes me feel like if they aren’t willing to put the effort in for the first date, why would they be willing to put the effort in long term? I always notice this about other couples when I’m out at restaurants not on a date too. The woman looks very cute and polished and the man she’s with looks like a hobo… Obviously there are exceptions, but I can’t help but notice a strong trend. 

Am I being too judgmental for thinking this way? Why do men approach dates like this?

Edit: to clarify by no means am I suggesting a suit or formalwear is expected, but showing your style and that you put a little effort in to look nice in your own way is really attractive! If that’s a fitted (clean) tshirt with a jacket and cool sneakers then great! Of course there will be times in the future where you are just going to grab some casual grub with your partner and wearing whatever you have on for the day is fine, but I think it’s strange to not want to dress up a bit when you are trying to make a first impression with someone you are on a date with.",ucmue3,541,381,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ucmue3/why_are_there_so_many_men_who_dont_dress_nicely/

He has literally pushed me up against a wall, wrestled with me and pinned me on the bed, grabbed me by the neck like he was choking me. Asked me to suck on his finger like I'm sucking dick. He has made several comments about me sucking his dick but we've never done anything sexual. He's pulled my hair to tease me and turn me on. Because he says we're just friends, I never touched him or tried to do anything sexual back to him.

He told me he didn't want me to get a second job because then I would have less time for him. He has discouraged me from dating other men.
He was incredibly jealous that I slept with another man. When I brought this up later he said he was jealous because I'm his friend.

We were spending all of our free time together and have stopped hanging out since he told me he's not attracted to me. He told me basically he only wants to hang out when we're around other friends and he was afraid since the beginning of our friendship that I would catch feelings. 

He said I mean a lot to him and he wants me in his life but he's been really distant and I find it hard to even look at him so we haven't really been talking or anything.

I'm just heartbroken and confused. Thoughts?


Edit to add a little background: Long story short, when I first met him I developed a crush pretty quickly but at the time he was trying to get back with his baby mama. We started hanging out more when baby mama decided to move to Texas. Then turns out baby isn't his. So the whole time he told me he's not ready for a relationship.

Too many posts about “what am I doing wrong?” “Am I ugly?” “I just can’t find anyone!”

Why do you think that is? They want you to become desperate enough so you’ll spend money on the “premium” version. And once they’ve roped you into that scam, do you really think they’re going to try to match you up? Of course not! 

Matching people up actually costs them money, so obviously they are going to do whatever it takes to keep you engaged and spending, just like ANY OTHER APP.

635,Awkward (sex based) questions I’m too afraid to ask anywhere but the internet.,"Probably NSFW so heads up. But definitely TMI. 

Alright so after spending some time working on myself , getting right with the world and my mission /purpose. I’d like to dip my toe into the dating game. Literally just looking to go on a date or two from time to time - to ensure I’m giving that dimension of my life some attention. 

But there’s one problem. Im a COMPLETE virgin at 24! Literally nothing - no action whatsoever. I got attention/active interest (“we should hang out” , “I’d like to get to know you”) but I had a lot of family stress growing up and I never pursued what I had back then thinking “it’ll come later” - well…it’s later. 

 I’m a chronic over thinker so there are questions that lowkey make me ashamed to ask but I might as well try: 

1. How does one kiss exactly?😂 is it literally just lips puckering against each other or is there some technique here I should “practice” (I don’t even think you can lmfao) 

1.5- I thought of this later before posting for the first time. But I have some kinda thing from childhood where I produce excess saliva — is there anyone out there with anything similar? Do you just constantly swallow your spit to avoid mixing with the other persons mouth like that? 

2. The pubes situation: (icky details, avoid this paragraph to avoid scarring) so I come from a family of mountain gorillas and we got HAIR. It’s nice cause my old man still has a full head of hair at his age — but that kinda growth is everywhere. Even to the point where it’s not just around the balls but on the balls themselves and dare I say on the shaft too — how immaculate does all this need to be? Do I really need to go in there with tiny scissors and get every hair on the genitals themselves? 

3. So I actually have somewhat low circulation (I’m seeing the docs) and my hands and feet get frigid cold - this weirdly worries me because the idea of holding hands or running my hands on someone’s spine rather than triggering pleasure /comfort it’s gonna be like “Dafuq- am I dating mr.freeze?” , I do warmup but it’s after a bit with a heat “source”. 

4. How does one even figure out their condom size? What measurement are they even in? Like what range is medium, large etc. it’s not like jeans where I can walk in and try one on lmao. And they are kinda expensive tbh. 

5. Sex itself - really good idea to brush up by reading? Get some techniques memorized I guess. Read up on stds? 

I know I know - but it’s precisely this kinda sex anxiety that prevents me from really getting out there. The idea being date goes well , sex initiates but I back out because I legit didn’t consider these things and it wracks my mind. 


Thanks to anyone with a little compassion and sympathy out there.

Edit: whoa you go to bed and come back to an RIP inbox ! Will definitely get back to as many people as I can where appropriate- I really appreciate the community for coming out like it has and feel blessed rn - have a good day everyone!

Edit 2: So I haven’t started answering comments (soon)  yet but another question did come to me (maybe it’s already answered) and I might keep a running list: 

6. What do I do if I discover I’m a two pump chump ? /come really fast 😂 do you laugh it off ? Transition to oral asap or what?

Edit #3: I think it's run its course - I'm seeing a lot of overlap which is good because that tells me - those things are consistent factors. I'm speechless at how much feedback I got and I was not expecting it -- I feel grateful for everyone who took time outta their day to get their input in (which was shockingly and overwhelmingly positive) - I still have a few people to get back too who took the time to write detailed answers, once my work ends tonight or more likely tomorrow. If you're a virgin like me out there and nervous- I hope some of these answers can help you.

I always know what I'm looking for. After I match, I want to see if we're both looking for the same thing. Because otherwise why waste each other's time? I think it's fantastic to get this cleared up early. Not in the first message, but maybe message number 4 or 5.

For example, if a girl is looking for something serious, I know I'm not the one for her, because I'm looking for something casual. By figuring we're not a match early on, we save each other a lot of trouble.

I don't think my standards are unreasonable. They're based off of my own lifestyle and interests, but maybe I think too highly of myself?

And, I was recently rejected out of the blue by a girl I really liked that I thought I had amazing chemistry with (I loved talking to her for hours just on the phone).

3 days after that he told me that he's sorry and that he misses me and that he will make time to see me. He told me that I am really special and that he doesn't want to hurt me again. I decided to give him a second chance.

I do like him but I know he has a lot going on, and honestly he can not give me the affection and attention I need in a serious relationship. 

We have intercourse a couple times a month and usually hang out as well and talk about anything and everything. It’s really nice and I’d like to continue this but when we have sex he says somethings that are a bit odd. It wasn’t so bad at first just like asking if he “is the best I’ve had” sexually and stuff but now he talks about getting married to him, getting pregnant, me moving into his place etc, mind you this all during sex and it’s very aggressive. 

Is this just a fetish or should I be concerned? He never use to say this stuff before but in the past 2 months it’s gotten progressively more intense. Otherwise our friendship is fine and he shows no signs of pushing for a relationship. 

Some side note: He has shown some jealousy in the past but nothing to extreme. We don’t go out on dates, his money is tight right now so that’s not really even an option.  I know I’m not his only fwb because I’m friends with his other fwb(there’s also a long story behind this too but not sure if it’s  relevant to all this.

646,She freaked out on me when we were making out,"I’m 23M, I met this 18F at a mutual birthday party of a friend who’s also my neighbor. For a bout a week me and this 18F really hit it off and chat constantly, she eventually comes to my place, Cooked for her, played FIFA, drank a bottle of wine. We get to making out and it’s going really well, A lot of kissing, intense cuddling, dry humping and boobs sucking, I licked her ear and boobs intensely and everything, at a point with her titty in my mouth she pushes me and starts crying and hitting me, I was so confused, she storms into the bathroom and starts sobbing and shouting. It was so embarrassing. I start apologizing because she turned to a different person and looked like she was gonna make a scene. I couldn’t tell if she was on crack or something. I continue pleading and asking her what I did wrong and she refuses to utter a word, she just wants to go home. Eventually I pay her Uber home. I explain to my neighbor(our mutual friend) what happened and she tells me that this girl apparently has a boyfriend and panicked midway of making out with me because she was angry/afraid of cheating on him with me. I become confused because she never told me she was dating and I never asked too. I call her in the evening of that day and she tells me she was crying and shouting because I sucked her boobs intensely and hurt her, even gave her marks, she said I had left her nipples sore and painful . I apologized and we’ve not spoken since then. It’s been a week now. My belief is that the swollen breast story is a lie, and her annoyance is projected anger on me because she almost cheats on her man with me. She hasn’t reached out since then but my mind can’t help but want to know the truth .",v6y9cy,528,280,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v6y9cy/she_freaked_out_on_me_when_we_were_making_out/

648,Is it normal to not find most women attractive,"So I'm a 24 year old virgin male with that has never had a gf. I hear advice all the time about going for it and not being scared of rejection however I dont think that describes at all. I'm not scared of rejection but I don't find most women attractive. In fact, in the last 5 years, I have only had two major crushes. And I wasn't scared to ask them out. But both rejected me. 

Now days I am just friends with alot of guys and I have no female friends. I never understood the concept of putting a girl on a pedestal because I don't get nervous when talking to women at all. Im not afraid to make passes but I'm rarely motivated to. I don't feel attracted and even if I do, I lose interest very quickly. 

For example, I lost interest in a woman that I was texting on a dating app after 3 days of texting. I ended up ghosting just because I forgot she existed. 


I wonder if any other guys feel this way?

650,Bisexual gf and her roommate were hooking up and it’s haunting me,"My gf (F21) and I (M21) have been dating for two months now and we really get along well, have similar interests etc. She is bisexual and has preferred girls previously. The thing I’m struggling with is that her and her current roommate (F21) were hooking up just before we met. They’re both extremely close with one another and have been best friends for many years. My gf told me during our first few dates about this and acknowledged it was a red flag but insisted it was purely platonic, had only happened when they were drunk at home, it “just happened”, and that they don’t do it when either of them is in a relationship. my gf told me the last time it happened was within the month before we met. I ignored it and felt it didn’t bother me at the time, which i now realise might have been a mistake considering i am an anxious person.

Through the following two months as I got to know her dynamic with her roommate better I discovered they were very deeply attached to each other and didn’t have a lot of other friends, her roommate often jokes about them getting married and stuff like that. They do everything together and often drink together at home alone which brings me alot of anxiety considering the past. Recently when my gf and I have been out at parties I notice some flirtiness between her and other girls when she’s drunk and adds their social medias and she often unconsciously blocks me out of the conversation. The line between platonic and romantic confuses me when it comes to being with a bisexual gf having only been with heterosexual girls previously and i don’t want to be insensitive.

At the moment, the history between her and her roommate has been haunting me. She is quite avoidant when it comes to emotions/emotional conversations and doesn’t like talking about feelings. But I told her how I felt 2 days ago and she told me i could ask anytime and there’s nothing there but was mostly quiet during the conversation and has been distant ever since (not texting during the day like we usually do) and is just hanging out with her roommate.

653,something casual while looking for something serious,"I (23F) had recently been seeing this guy (23M). We went on 3 dates, slept together on dates 2 and 3. A while after our 3rd date we had the ""what do you want out of this"" conversation over text, he said he was looking for casual whereas I had just decided to start for looking for something more serious (having only had casual relationships in the past). So we ended it there on good terms, no hard feelings.

The thing is, the sex was really really good, the best I've ever had, so I'm starting to regret ending it. I do want something serious in the long run with someone who wants the same, but I don't see the harm in having a good time with this guy while I'm searching. I know it could be a mess feelings wise, but so could anything casual and I've navigated relationships like this before without any major hurt feelings.

Would it be strange to text him again and see if he'd be up for hooking up casually? And if not, how do I go about it without sending wild mixed signals?

EDIT: getting a lot of people saying no self-respecting guy would ever date a girl who behaves like me so I’m not gonna reply to them all, but just wanna clarify if I met someone I want to date seriously I would end it with this guy. My plan was never to string someone along while I carried on fucking another guy. Kinda taking a beating here, which is my own fault for posting, but I’m gonna stop responding for now. Thanks for all your advice.

EDIT 2: ok this is the last time I’m looking at this post lol. I really didn’t except this level of response. A lot of people are jumping to my conclusions about my morals and values. You can think whatever you want, if you wouldn’t seriously date someone who previously had a FWB that’s your choice, but me enjoying having sex is not a bad reflection on my character no matter what you say. It doesn’t mean I’d ever cheat. It doesn’t mean I’d lie and hide it. It doesn’t mean I can’t control myself because I’m a slave to my primal instincts or whatever. I simply wanted to have a good time until I found the right person for me, in a way that’s safer and more enjoyable than ONS. I never wanted to be in a serious relationship while sleeping with another man, and I never would. The dating scene might be different in different places or for different ages, but I’ve been dating for quite a while and I really didn’t expect this post to sound so outrageous to so many people.

There’s also a lot of people who’re concerned about my feelings or how it would affect my openness to something serious, so thank you, I really appreciate your wisdom and advice. And thanks again to everyone else who gave advice, sorry I can’t reply to it all.",vf3afq,523,312,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vf3afq/something_casual_while_looking_for_something/

When they reject me they typically are pretty nice about it, so I was confused why she reacted like I did something wrong by asking her out.

658,Girl I am seeing blurted out her promiscuity while drunk and I feel like it the end of the road. Should I let her know the real reason or just lie?,"Hi I am M31 & recently started seeing this girl F27. It's been 2 months. Yesterday she came to my place for Christmas and we hung out. She drank a bit and started talking about her hookups.  She said she had this fetish of sleeping with an older man so she set her preference to 35-40 on bumble. She met this rich guy M 39 who was a lawyer and she went to his place to sleep with him after the first date. They hooked up a couple of times. 

He turned out to be married with children (obviously). So she broke it off. But it sounded like he was the one who told her it was just casual and he wanted nothing more from her than that. 

Now the same thing happened with me too. We slept together exactly the same way. After the first date. Later she told me during the same conversation that she slept with a friend of hers who came to my house to watch a game and have beers (I found it a bit off putting that she invited him with my consent and prior disclosure of sexual history, although I was present there) She also told me she went on a trip and scored some marijuana and smoked with a guy and slept with him later. 

She goes on a lot of solo trips and asks for marijuana from random people. Now I can't get it out of my head that she sleeps with atleast some of them. 

I feel like she betrayed me when she told me to sleep with her without a condom a couple of days ago. I didn't know all these details and would have never agreed to it if I knew it. She didn't divulge that she indulges in casual sex. She even asked me to go in raw the first time she was with me but i refused. 

I think I am over this fling of ours. Should I tell her what I feel about what she told me?  Or just end it by lying?  I am sure she will be devastated as she seems to be very attached to me. She has introduced me to all her friends. I have introduced her to none of mine.

671,Scared he might give me a ticket if I end things.,"I (F23) have been seeing a guy (M36) for 4 months now. Everything was going well at first but as time went on I noticed that he was becoming more controlling. 

He would make comments about my clothing (too short/too cropped/too nice for work) and would keep tabs on me throughout the day. Everytime I would check my phone I would see a missed call or text from him. 

I went to a work party with him (he's a police officer) and he introduced me as his fiance to his colleagues. After that incident (he said he misspoke) I decided to pull back. 

When he would try to make plans I would say I was busy or wasn't feeling well. 

But now he's starting to notice a shift in our relationship. I bumped into him at the grocery store last week and he pulled me aside for a chat. He said that he missed me and was looking forward to our next date. 

He said that he would ""hate to put a tracker on my car"" because it's getting harder to reach me. He laughed after he said it but I was kind of uncomfortable. We parted ways after that and he said he would call me soon. 

After leaving the grocery store I ran into him in the parking lot and he approached me again to tell me to drive safe or he would have to give me a ticket. He laughed and then told me he would see me Friday. I didn't give him my availability when we spoke in the store but he had already decided that we were going out Friday. 

How do I go about ending things with him?

 If I try to ghost him he keeps calling/texting. And when I cancel on him I still end up running into him at the grocery store/gym/and once at the bank.

UPDATE:

After reading your messages I decided to call him and end it. He said that I ""blindsided"" him and that I knew that he was serious about me. He told me that he loved me and can't imagine his life without me in it. 

I repeated that I don't want to see anymore and he told me that I needed time to cool down and he would see me on Saturday for our date.

672,"When does ""being busy"" actually start to mean they're not interested or seeing you as a priority?","I just want to see what experiences you guys have had with the other person constantly not replying a lot, or hanging out consistently bc theyre ""busy"" all the time. In my own experience even when I was working and in school which took about 50-60 hours of my time a week, I would always find time to be with someone I want to be with or around. Especially if they're a high priority in my life. I always give the benefit of the doubt but tbh, I honestly don't think anyone can be that busy to where you can't see someone regularly somewhat. Deep down I think they have better options to them that they choose to spend their free time and with and prob just hangout or talk to me when no one else is available or a la last resort hence the low prioritization. What do yall think?

EDIT: IMO if you're someone that does this, pls stop and tell the person that you don't want to be serious or high priority with them, its much better than stringing the other person along, especially if they're an optimist like me.and believe you. Im a dude btw lol

676,What should I do if she still cuddles with me even if she does more with her ex?,"I (22M) found her (22F) in my university through a friend. We connected on day one. Same likes same playlist, same anime and a lot of similarities. We started talking on phone calls late at night till morning. She did mention her ex but they haven't done it. I have had no proper relationship so wasn't aware much and accepted that people do talk to their ex. She started staying with me late at night in my room. We would cuddle the whole night. I would sometimes kiss her here and there but we never had a proper one. This continued for a month with few hurdles and fights.

Then her ex came to our city and she went with him on day out's and she admitted to me while we were cuddling that she went with him and did what we were doing without clothes but still didn't do anything more than touching.

This made me feel like I am being cheated on even though we are not in a relationship nor she has ever expressed an interest in a relationship. Every time we had this conversation she would say she sees me as a friend and nothing more than that.

I have come to this SubReddit to get some serious help on how to move? And should I even continue cuddling as this is and will keep happening until either she or I stop it?

PS: I really like the girl and want a relationship but she doesn't want and I respect that

Update 1: She came to visit me and she tried to cuddle me and then I told her we can do this anymore and may not stay friends either. she asked 4-5 times ""are you sure?"" and I replied yes and then she stormed off

Update 2: At night around 2-3 am, she called me, when I asked what was the reason, she was like she is scared and wanted to talk to someone. I listened for 2-3 min and then I told her I'm sleepy and wanted to cut the call but she pleaded to wait and then I told her if u really want someone as you are scared to call her ex and I cut the call.

677,Been told twice in a row that there “wasn’t a spark” after the first date,"I (24m) don’t go on many dates, and a lot of the ones I do go on aren’t very good. But the last two good dates I’ve had were very similar stories. Met on Hinge, texted for over a week very frequently, met up for dinner or coffee, had a great time just chatting about each others’ lives, and then get a text the next day:

“I think you’re a super kind, sweet guy, but I just didn’t feel the connection I’m looking for.”

I appreciate the decency and honesty up front, but after multiple rounds of this same story, it stings. I’m of the opinion that you usually aren’t sure of that connection/“spark” right away, and I think one date is a bit soon to tell for sure. Am I wrong here? I want to be respectful, and I obviously can’t force how someone feels, but I’m tired of first date after first date with the same result.

EDIT: I see that the “you’re too ugly/not funny enough/too short” troll crowd has arrived, so I’m ignoring the comments from here on out.

678,Asking a woman out on a date will lower your chances. Here's what I do instead.,"I (23M) learned this from a woman I dated a while back. Strap in, because it's storytime :) 

Once I dated a good looking party-girl who somehow stumbled upon me. She was obviously very confident, and we started chatting. I had a low self-image at the time and wasn't going to risk embarrassing myself, but to my surprise she was the one who ended up inviting me out. 

 While we were dating, she never once ""asked"" me out on a ""date"". Whenever we were about to part ways, she'd always suggest the next thing we were going to do (ex: ""Let's go to 'X' place"" or ""You should come and do 'Y' with me""). She never really left it up for me to approve: she just knew that I'd agree to whatever she wanted to do next.

See here's the thing: she was not used to being rejected. I don't mean that in a bad way— quite the opposite. She was good looking and, subsequently, she was used to positive feedback from men. Therefore, there was a certain ""automatic-ness"" that was threaded through her words whenever she reached out to me. It wasn't forceful or rude— it was just assumed that I'd agree to whatever she wanted to do.

We ended up breaking it off after a few months (she travels for work), but I took that lesson with me. A week or two after we split, I met a woman at a park who was cute and seemed very friendly. I was nervous, of course, because I knew I was about to try what the previous woman had shown me but I wasn't sure if it'd work. I was trying to figure out how I'd ask her out when she started telling me about this lake in our city she likes to go to. Before I knew it, these words jumped out of my mouth:

""We should go there sometime!""

I was anticipating her smile to twist into a grimace, but to my surprise she said ""Yeah, we should!"" without missing a beat. Mind you, this is a pretty cute, in-shape college woman: clearly upper-class and the type of woman I could've only dreamed about dating years ago. She had just agreed to go on a date with me. Easily.

I actually dragged the conversation out a little longer because I just couldn't believe she sincerely agreed. I even did my best to give her an ""out"", but when I was getting ready to leave she insisted. In terms of her schedule she gave me the pick of the litter (she was free any day I wanted to go). We exchanged numbers and before I even got home she had already texted me about how it was nice to meet me. 

Insanity. Like, this was the real deal. After years of being laughed at and made fun of by women (I used to be pretty fat back in the day), here I was picking up a woman I'd never met. A good-looking girl too. When we went out for our first date, she was eager to see me and we hung out until the sun went down. I was stunned by how easily I'd gotten her to date me. 

Of course I had to try that again. So a few weeks later I end up chatting with another woman of a similar demographic (good looking, educated, in-shape, etc.), except she was taller than me. I'm not tall by any stretch of the imagination (5'8 on a good day) and she was pretty close to 6ft, so I was expecting her to shut me down pretty quick. We were having a decent conversation though so I decided to try my luck (using the same formula) and wouldn't you know— she said yes too. No hesitation, no excuses. 

""You know, we should go to [hiking spot in our city] sometime.""

""Yeah, that sounds fun!"" 

Who would've thought? No compliments, no confession of feelings, no pickup lines— just a suggestion. It sounds so simple and obvious, but it worked. I've been using this method ever since, and my success rate has easily doubled (if not tripled) from what it used to be (I've gotten about 5 or 6 dates so far off of maybe 7 or 8 attempts. Keep in mind it's a small sample size, but these numbers are drastically better than what they used to be for me). 

One of my favorite things about this method is that it doesn't leave room for them to think about telling you ""No"". In my opinion, ""asking"" someone out is basically telling them to evaluate whether you are good enough for them. That, in my view, can suggest some level of insecurity: as if you aren't sure you meet their standards. Suggesting you both do something specific together communicates to them that you already believe you are good enough, and it doesn't put them into evaluation-mode (where they're a lot more likely to be critical of you). 

Also too, it's much easier to work into a conversation, and it's much easier to recover from if they're not interested. All you need to do is steer the conversation toward some place they like to go or activity they like to do, which is very easy to do with both strangers and acquaintances. It's works well for subsequent date arrangements too.

There are various ways you can word it— these aren't magic words that have to be recited perfectly. I think the key things are:

- Framing it as a suggestion rather than a request (""Let's..."", ""We should..."", ""I think we'd have fun if we..."" etc.)
- Being ambiguous about when. This relieves the pressure of them having to think about their schedule on the fly. Once they agree to the initial suggestion, then you can hash out a time/date— but not a moment before. 
- Basing it on the conversation. If you can get them talking about something they like to do or some place they like to go, they'll take care of the first date idea for you and you won't have to worry about whether they'll like where you both are going. 
- Saying it with mild enthusiasm. Your tone should be about the same as it would be if you found out they liked your favorite band or that they happened to be watching the same show you're watching on Netflix: you should show some level of genuine enthusiasm, but not so much that it sounds like it was the highlight of your week. 

I'll admit that I was sad to let the party-girl go. She was a ton of fun, and made me feel super sexy by proxy of being with her. Even so, she taught me something that I'll never forget, and I'll have to get around to thanking her sometime. Hopefully what she taught me can benefit some of you as well.",ueaze9,505,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ueaze9/asking_a_woman_out_on_a_date_will_lower_your/
679,"How should I reveal to women I go on dates with, that I am a 30-year-old kissless virgin?","So I (33m) have been recently meeting women; looking for a long-term relationship, and primarily I meet women who of course have more experience than I do in relationships and sex, especially considering that I'm a virgin in my 30s with little to no intimate experience to speak of. 

I am currently seeing someone (28f) with whom I'm set to go on a third date, and she seems to want to get more flirtatious and eventually get comfortable talking about sex. She is very confident and has already revealed her past relationships and sexual exploits on our last date, and she casually did ask about my experiences, but I was mainly coy about it (for obvious reasons). I've sort of decided to reveal to her the next time I see her that I am a virgin and see how she reacts and if she wants to continue to take things further.

So I guess my question really is, how does one in my situation even go about revealing such a thing to women he hopes to date long-term without coming off too embarrassed and/or unattractive,? Because something like this is considered unexpected and uncommon in today's day in age.   

For the record, I did reveal to one girl I met before in a playful way. She did find it amusing and became a lot more interested and invested in seeing me post that.

681,"The guy I’m dating is too perfect, why don’t I like him? (25F)","Hi ya’ll, 

So I’m having a weird problem. This guy I’m dating is literally perfect. He ticks off all the boxes. Attractive( he is tall & works out), great job (works in tech), smart & empathetic - he is so sweet to me. The point is I can’t seem to find any flaws and I feel bad because he is so nice to me but for some reason I’m not drawn to him as he is to me. I do like him but I find him just a bit boring and I don’t have that spark & he doesn’t make me laugh. He is very stoic and extremely quite and chill. He doesn’t take many risks and plays life on the safe side. I’m literally the opposite. Loud, a bit extra, goofy, spontaneous and always up for an adventure. 

My question is - what’s wrong with me? Lol. Are relationships supposed to be boring / this perfect. Am I being picky if he doesn’t make me laugh or likes taking risks? Has anyone dated Mr. Right on paper and felt this way? 


EDIT: I understand that sometimes 'boring' is part of a healthy relationship. I'm not seeking a toxic guy that gives me a rush. The problem is that we don't have the same sense of humor. He doesn't poke fun at me nor challenge me intellectually. He is just very plain honestly. For the guys on here, just imagine dating a really hot girl (model) who is kind, agreeable, and doesn't have much to say - not much depth or personality and just a bit plain.  Would you continue dating her because she is a catch and 'perfect' or not settle, move on and hopefully find someone who matches your energy (even though there is no guarantee that you find someone better)?

On the date, we kissed and all but I noticed she wasn't really comfortable with anything more sexual. I asked her and she confirmed it, so I obviously let it go. However, after the date, I started connecting the dots in my head and realized the possibility that she wanted to wait until marriage was a pretty solid one.

I texted her and asked, and she again confirmed it and said ""I only want to have sex after marriage and nothing could possibly change my mind,"" with all the words. 

I crave a sexual and emotional connection with a partner, as I think both are ways of solidifying the relationship. The fact that she doesn't want to have sex AT ALL for what would be years is kind of a deal breaker for me.

Otherwise, we're pretty compatible. What should I do? Should I continue to date her and enjoy the moments or let it go? Was I too blunt? Did I ask too early?",rgmwev,491,462,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rgmwev/the_girl_im_dating_wants_to_wait_until_marriage/

689,[27/f] What should I do? I find most guys boring because they can't engage in witty banter. [Dating],"

The guys I've been into have been excellent, creative conversationalists and extremely witty. Our conversations are challenging and fun. I've only dated a few guys that have met this need for stimulating conversation. 

I hate chatting about my weekend, who won my volleyball game, what I did, getting my car fixed, seeing my sister and how happy I was to see her. 

I view the world with a humorous lense. If someone doesn't understand this and can't meet me equally with it, I am not attracted to them. I want a partner to be my mental equal who I can use as a rejuvenating source of fun. 

For example. If someone asks ""good morning, how was your day?"" I DREAD texting back. Rather, if someone texts, ""How many girls did you make cry at roller derby today?"" I'm smiling and planning my answer sarcastically. 

This goes for face-to-face conversations as well. I dead pan extremely well. I've been called extremely quick on my feet thinking while socializing.

I realize the need for serious conversations and am fully able to have those conversations as often as they are needed. But I need fun. I want that in a relationship.

The thing is, I'm really lonely. I have a lot of hobbies. I play sports, roller skate, enjoy being active. I'd love to find a relationship with someone who....

1. Understands my humor/ meets my wit
2. Wants what I want 
3. Similar values 

Most people/dates like me and want another date so I know I'm not annoying or anything.

I've gone on online dates with kind, attractive men who are interested in me. In 99% of these cases they can't banter with me, either in person or face to face, and instead view conversation as very literal. I'm unstimulated and distracted from them and even though they like me and are interested in me,  i absolutely dread seeing them so I let them go after 1-3 dates. 

TLDR: My friends can't imagine why I'm so picky because they don't really understand my witty, communication style. It's essential to my attraction to someone. What should I do? Try to make it work with someone i find debilitating boring? It just feels so isolating.

690,Found a cheat code on how to get better at talking to women,"This is mainly for guys who are shy (me) and who don’t really get to talk to women that much.

So I got a job at this dog/cat boarding place around 5 months ago and we currently have around 20 employees. 16 of those employees are women (most around my age) so when I work I’m mainly talking to women everyday.

I know this isn’t really flirting with women but it helped me tremendously just being able to talk to women. Before I got this job I rarely ever talked to a girl in public and when I did I was a stuttering mess and would be so bad at having a conversation with a women even if it wasn’t me hitting on them and just a regular conversation. The problem I had that I would put them on a pedestal so it was hard for me.

Now after 5 months I’m able to talk to women so much better with regular conversations. Since I had to talk to women at my job overtime I stopped putting them on a pedestal and just talked to them like a regular person. Now I’m not nervous as much to talk to women and it’s helped me a ton in my dating life.

So yeah if your a young guy like me (I’m 20) and have trouble talking to girls get a part time job where there’s mainly women there and after some time working there you should hopefully see some results. Don’t hit on them just talk to them normally. This will probably not work for everyone but I thought it might help someone.

They’re not completely wrong sentences… but they’re just more true for girls (ofc not for all the girls).

Guys can’t sit there and wait.

Ofc there are exceptions: extremely good looking guys (models, basically) will surely be approached, or very courageous girls will surely approach guys they like… but these are all extremely small percentages.

As I was a shy guy myself in my early 20s, I had to accept that we guys are supposed to approach (and basically start everything) basically always.

Only when I took my dating life into my own hands and started approaching women I liked (failed fck tons of time, tried to not take it personal and learn from my mistakes) started I see some success and the more success I experienced the better my confidence got and it snowballed from there.

Guys… just approach girls when you feel you can do that. I’m not saying approach is fantastic, and not even horrible… it’s just what you got to do. 

It can be wonderful, if you see the girl is interested. It can be awful, if you see she’s not. Just do it when you really feel you can ( and especially want ). 

Acknowledge that you’ll have to be the ones to do that in most of the cases.

He reached out to me on a dating app a year later - we talk, he says he isn't looking for anything serious, I say we can be friends, FWB situation starts, I tell myself it's something I can handle (wasn't in the right headspace for a relationship at the time).

We've been FWB-ing for a year and a half now. We never updated our 'terms,' and I never asked in fear of losing someone I really liked spending time with and definitely had feelings for.

On Sunday, I log onto Facebook and see that he's made it Facebook official with someone else. Meanwhile, he was just texting to see me in early December ...

I felt like my brain and my heart were on fire and both were itching for me to say something ... So, I texted him last night. I gave myself a good amount of time to process it, so I didn't sound so emotional. I apologized if it was an awkward text to receive, but that I'd regret not saying something in the long-term. I then told him I wished it'd been us in the end and that I had been meaning to tell him for a while now, but that it never felt right (and probably didn't for a reason because we were on two separate pages). I then ended it by wishing him the best.

He has not responded. I am okay with that and quite honestly expected it. I sent the text for me and me only - to wash my hands clean of him. But goodness, it hurts. The lack of decency, respect, etc. to not formally end things with or respond to someone you've known and have shared intimate moments with for almost three years ...

On the other hand, I feel freer than I've felt in years. I made myself miserable for the sake of keeping him in my life. I want answers (Why did he not respond? Why didn't he give me the smallest amount of decency after a three year saga and wish me well, too? Why did he commit to her and not me? When should I pull the plug and finally delete him off of social media? Is he the asshole in this situation?). I realized, though, that *sometimes you need to choose peace over answers*.

Since he didn't choose me, I will make a conscious effort from now 'til forever to choose myself. I will try to embrace all of the parts of me that I abandoned when I was with him.

Just thought I'd share if whoever's reading this is also in a soul-sucking FWB situation. Get out when you can and make it easier for yourself in the long run. They usually don't and won't change, no matter how amazing you know you are. You deserve more. You deserve someone who chooses you - even and especially when that someone is yourself.",s1qef6,477,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/s1qef6/i_26f_broke_the_1_rule_of_fwb/
695,Finally set my boundary though it was hard,"I (24F) had an amazing date with this guy I met off of tinder. We had easy conversation, he cooked me dinner, held my hand, kissed me, was super sweet and overall, I really liked him. 

Fast forward to the next week, he kindly let me know that he wasn’t ready for a relationship because his new job has been taking up him time. He said he’s be delighted to see me but wanted to tell me before he came over for the next date. 

I ended up being upset that he wasn’t ready for a relationship. But I respected him for letting me know because I’ve been played before. I ended up letting him come over and we had sex. 

It has been a week since that and I finally decided that I need to respect my own boundaries: no sex early on and don’t invest my time in someone who clearly told me he isn’t ready yet. So I sent him a text telling him that I did like him a lot but I don’t think I could have a casual relationship ship with him without developing feelings and getting myself hurt in the end. 

I realized I let myself ponder at the possibility of something casual in hopes he would change his mind in the future and want to date me. And I shouldn’t do that because all that leads to is disappointment. In the past, I have done that. 

I know it’s dumb but I’m proud of myself for texting him and stepping back.


Edit: for those of you shaming me in these comments or my dms about me having sex with him…I thought I could do something casual and be able to handle it but decided not to via the reasons above.",vb10cr,480,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vb10cr/finally_set_my_boundary_though_it_was_hard/

697,Is it normal a guy texting fwb everyday?,"Basically just like the title. I (25f) started to hook up with a guy(25m) 1.5 months ago. I initiated the fwb after talking on Tinder and he went along with it.

Thing is that he is VERY talkative toward me. It is always he initials all the talks and I tend to just snap him for some sexy photo/arrange  time etc.

recently, he started to send me a snap about whatever he is doing probably 3~4 times a day, every morning/before night. Just talks about random stuff, his pets (lol), his food(?), never anything sexual. 

Edided2 : also he ALWAYS replies in seconds or no more than 10 mins no matter when. But I usually take a few hours to reply...

I don't mind him doing that but I'm just really curious. Is he just being FRIENDLY?

Thank you so much!

Edited 3: thanks everyone who gives advice and I never thought it would be so much!

I think I missed a big point is that when I started fwb and mentioned “I don't want anything serious now” and he replied “ I don't want anything super serious too” so I'm just always assuming he is just being friendly",rzh0sc,481,252,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rzh0sc/is_it_normal_a_guy_texting_fwb_everyday/
698,A few things I've learned online dating as a man. I really wish I could have told myself this a year ago:,"If I had a time machine to a year ago, here's what I would have told myself:

1) It's totally normal for most first dates to not go to 2nd dates.  It's not necessarily a reflection of you.  It's actually kind of rare for 2 strangers from the internet to click in person.  Don't take it personally.

2) You have to make your own closure.  It's rare for the other person to bluntly tell you what went wrong.  Of course you can politely ask while you have the chance, but don't expect to get the full truth.  Chances are you know where you screwed up more than they do anyways.

3) If there's a spark on the first date, a woman will usually give you a couple more dates.  You HAVE to read her signals, make moves and escalate or else she'll just move on.  These are dates and not business meetings.  Never go more than 2 dates without kissing her, or else it starts becoming weird for both of you.  Strike while the iron is hot and she still likes you.

4) Having go to date spots is a good thing.  No need to constantly try to reinvent the wheel.  Also having go to date outfits is pretty common as well.  I feel less anxious when I've been somewhere before as opposed to going somewhere brand new.

5) She's nervous, so try and make her feel comfortable.

Feel free to add to my list with things you've learned",winrl4,478,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/winrl4/a_few_things_ive_learned_online_dating_as_a_man_i/

700,Could you date someone who’s quite a bit stupider than you?,"I know it’s crass way of putting it because how do you measure intelligence anyway? Well I’m referring to someone who simply doesn’t seem to think as deeply about things, who isn’t really willing to discuss or debate anything, who doesn’t have much appreciation for subtlety or irony, who is quite literal minded, who isn’t very creative or imaginative. You know the type.

It completely wastes my time whenever I send the first message and wait for a reply. They don't even put it in their bio that they have one.

702,I’m learning to stop putting the pressure of “forever” on new potential relationships.,"I’ve met someone I really like but I’ve been hesitant to take it further because I’m afraid it’ll just eventually go sour…like all the other ones. My anxiety will scare them away or I’ll be “too much” or I’ll eventually hear “I can’t be the partner you deserve.” It makes me want to hide away and not even bother, I mean, Ive worked hard to build a good life for myself!

Then I realized that a relationship ending doesn’t invalidate the love or growth that happened during it. And what is the obsession with forever anyway? Love is about wanting what’s best for the other person, even if it’s not you, and life is about seizing opportunities, taking leaps of faith, and loving as deeply as we can because it can all be over in the blink of an eye.

Love can happen over and over again. It evolves, morphs, heals, and shows us who we want to be, and I’ve gotten wonderful experiences and hard lessons from all of my relationships, even if they didn’t “end in death or marriage” (which seems to be society’s metric for success). Just because we are in a relationship doesn’t mean we don’t still have our own individual journeys- people come and go and they’re on their own paths.

I’m not saying you shouldn’t protect yourself or be careful…but if you’re holding back out of fear…maybe reconsider if that’s worth missing out on life for. I’m holding on so tightly to the very things that are stifling my growth…here’s hoping I can slowly learn to let go.

It feels like I was rap3d but I let it happen:(( Now everytime we see each other we always have S and part of me enjoys it but a part of me is sad because I wasn’t ready and now he’s also changed because before he was really putting on effort and giving me extravagant gifts but now it’s all fading and he’s starting to act like a snob at times.

709,I DID IT!!! I’M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW,"Last night I [18M] confessed to a girl [19F] (but basically same age as me) that I really liked and she said she liked me back! 

I barely even considered doing this until a few hours before and I was thinking about it and was like “yeah, I’m feeling good- I think think I’m gonna do it tonight”. It was over text (because it’s winter break and she is very far away from me) and I tried a few short conversations to see if I could find a window to lead into my confession but all of them flopped so I just decided to drop the leads and just straight-up go for it.

Moral of the story: As a pretty shy guy myself, if you think there’s at least a fair chance it will work, just go for it and tell her you like her. 

Extra advice: Make it clear that you are worried that she may be uncomfortable. Maybe this was just my situation, but the girl I confessed to told me that her “respect for [me] skyrocketed” because I showed that I cared how my confession may have made her feel.

710,Dating for women is a paradox. Independent women attract selfish men.,"My experience is women who wouldn’t owe things to men (always split the bills, never care about gifts, etc) always attract selfish men who wouldn’t contribute to the family even after they’re married. But most of the women I know are too proud to ask for anything from men. It’s weird. You’ll MORE likely end up with a lame dude who probably wants to take advantage of you if you’re independent, if you’re a woman.

Edit: I feel this post gets twisted a lot. I’m not saying men should pay for dates. I’m not saying men don’t encounter gold diggers. There are gold diggers for sure but it’s not relevant to my post.

712,Dating a guy for the first time and not sure if I should let this slip,"So after reading the current ""hot post"" with a funny typo in the title (asking if someone is shallow not wanting to date because of body count), I remembered something my boyfriend and I talked about a bit ago. For context, I am 25, he is 28. Long story short, I only dated women my whole life and he is the first guy I ever felt attracted to. We have been seeing each other exclusively since the end of last year and it's the most healthy relationship I've had so far. But I'm not used to dating men and thus not sure what is ""normal"" and what isn't. 

A while ago we had a conversation about body count. He has had about 20 bed partners before me (all women), and I have had 6 different bed partners before him (all women). He told me that he is glad that I don't have a high body count, and I was like why? He then proceeded to tell me that there's a difference between man and woman, that it's way easier for a woman to have sex and that it's more of a victory for a man to have sex. And that a woman with a high body count can be seen as easy and thus harder to see her as ""relationship material"". While I agree with him that getting sex as a (heterosexual) woman is easier than a (heterosexual) man, I don't get why that should really influence your relationship especially if you have a high body count yourself? I found it to be a weird double standard, no woman I dated has ever voiced concerns about body counts.  

While I said I didn't completely agree with him, I also didn't want to start a whole discussion so I just changed the subject. But now that I read that reddit post, I'm not sure it was something I should've brushed off so easily. 

Edit: this post really blew up and I want to thank everyone that commented. I have been provided with insights that made it clear to me that I won't address the body count conversation again, but I will address the following things to him sometime soon irl, and am also curious what your opinions are on these matters:

- Does he view women and men as being equal? If not, is there a respectable explanation for why not? For example if he says women and men aren't the same biologically but should still be treated the same? 

- I started thinking about other conversations we had, and I realized that something else didn't sit right with me because I feel fetishized; I don't want him to kiss anyone else, but he doesn't mind me kissing another women as long as he's there because it's ""hot"". At first  l responded that I could be open for that but I realized I have no intention kissing ANYONE else now that I'm in a relationship and that I would only kiss someone to please him, which is a turn off honestly. I think it's better to address how it makes me feel and see whether he can respect my boundaries.

716,"Anybody else tired of ""soft rejections""?","Months ago I got the whole, ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" talk, saw her with another guy like a week later, and felt gutted. I felt like we were really compatible and it took me a bit to get over it. Had she just said she wasn't feeling it, I could have moved on so much easier.  

Well, she came back. She messaged me the other day, then again today saying we should hang out some time. Regardless of how I felt months ago, I won't pursue anything because the way she handled things the first time is sort of repulsive to me. If she can't communicate basic things like where I stand, being in a relationship with her would probably be exhausting. I told her verbatim:

""Hey, I'm glad you're wanting to rekindle things presumably because the stars just didn't align last time, but I'm not interested. You're pretty cool and we share similar interests, but I strongly value good communication and last time we spoke, you weren't good with that. You had the right to break things off with me, but you were entirely dishonest with your reason for ending things. A relationship or friendship with you just isn't something I'm interested in, take care"".  

Dating coaches may say that makes me come off as overly emotional, but I think it's just straight to the point. I don't have time to deal with that stuff and if that type of reply makes them reconsider their approach with others in the future, even just once, it was worth it.

I just wish more people were honest. I'm an adult, I don't bite, respect my time as well as yours. If you just want to be friends, tell me. If you have no intention of even being my friend and never want to see me again, don't say ""let's be friends"".

717,How do I navigate modern dating as a young man?,"Why have the women I’ve interacted with been so hurtful?

Ex recently broke up with me. Have taken a lot of time to reflect on past relationships with women in general.

I’ve had women tell me they were surprised my penis wasn’t small because they thought I was Asian. (I am native and Mexican as well as other things). Who says something like that? Even if I WERE Asian, that’s an awful thing to say.

My first interaction with a girl was when I lost my virginity and she lied to me and said she was pregnant just to mess with me. (According my to cousin who was her friend at the time).

I’ve had my ex-girlfriend tell me that I was so patient and that if I treated her the way she treated me, she would break up with me. What!? How does that even make sense!? How do you just openly admit your faults and then just brush it off??

I’ve tried to open up to girlfriends in the past and they just tell me that they “don’t want to have to have this conversation again” anytime I tried to open up about my mental health issues. Basically telling me to man up.

I’m becoming so fed up with women, not in a hateful way, but I am just exhausted.

I talked to my aunt about my breakup and made the mistake of making the comment “women make me sad” and her immediate response was “men make women sad” like dude im hurting right now. Obviously everyone can be a POS, but you can’t just say “break-ups are hard for everyone” or something??

I feel like my emotional needs should be nonexistent. And I feel guilty for even having emotions. Do you guys feel stuff like this? I know I can’t be the only one. I honestly feel like just staying single all of my life to avoid the pain and misery, but I also know that nothing in life is supposed to be easy and I am afraid I would only be stunting my growth as a person.

Fast forward till Tuesday, we started talking to me about Astrology and how she knew it better than most people. I teased her about it and asked her to guess my sun sign. She guesses wrong obviously and said I was a Scorpio and I retorted that I'm a Libra. Then I followed that up with stating I think astrology is interesting but I personally take it as a grain of salt as I don't believe the constellations of stars determine our personality as humans. She then replies with ""oh, you're a Libra?! I don't typically get along with Libras. What does your birth chart look like?"". I send her a SS of what it looks like and make the point about Astrology not being the ""be all end all"" of humanity since we seem to click irl despite not being the most compatible of
zodiacs (didn’t even know this was a thing). She proceeds to reply with ""hmm, idk if we're a good fit long term.the chart isn't promising either"". I asked what about it isn't ""promising"" and I
never got a reply. This was sent this past Tuesday to put it into perspective and we have a supposed date today evening.



Really not sure what to do or say at this point. I've had a lot of disappointments over the past 8-9 months but this one will probably sting the most since I actually gave myself genuine hope with this girl. I felt this was mutual up until the topic of astrology came up. Haven’t sent a confirmation text but at this point, is there a need?

719,Girlfriend slept in same bed as gay male best friend.,"My long distant girlfriend recently went on a trip with her gay best friend and his parents and they slept in the same bed. I met him once in person, he seemed real nice. She even posted a picture of him sleeping on her close friends insta story and said “sweet dreams”. 

Should I feel alarmed by this? At first it made me feel really uncomfortable but then I realized that I fully trust my girlfriend, and that maybe it’s silly to feel weird about it.

720,Girl keeps intentionally leaving her underwear at my place. Am I supposed to do something with it?,"I've been seeing a girl for about 2 months. We started off casual with lots of sex, but have continued to progress into dating and exclusivity. She's a little kinky and eccentric, but extremely thoughtful, sweet, and so freaking cute.

I say she's a little kinky because she really likes the erotic fiction kinda stuff like 50 Shades of Grey, Ice Planet Barbarians, etc. She keeps leaving her underwear at my place, and I'm wondering if it's some sort of kink that I should play into?

She only leaves underwear after sex, but not every time. She leaves the underwear in different places. I'm still trying to figure it out, but I think if I remove her underwear she might just leave it wherever it's removed? On my bed, on my couch, on the floor... I ran my Roomba  once and it dragged and dropped her panties into some random spot in my house and I spent like 30 mins frantically searching around for them. There may still be undiscovered panties throughout the house.

She continues to leave more and more underwear. I think I've collected about 6 so far. I've washed them and collected them all into a bag but she never takes them back home. What am I supposed to do with them? Is this some sort of kink?

Edit: It's other clothes too. Shirts, shorts, sweaters. So it sounds like she's marking her territory?? I asked her to be sexually exclusive like a month ago and we deleted dating apps together. I don't think I've done anything to make her feel like I'm still messing around with other girls. I just haven't officially asked her out yet because I like to take things slow.",x39dce,453,219,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/x39dce/girl_keeps_intentionally_leaving_her_underwear_at/

""Oh I don't get mad at him for X, I knew whom he was and about his issues all of those years ago, and I still chose him, and I still choose him today, in the end people make choices""

And that stuck because it made me realize, we deny ourselves love sometimes because we are afraid those people will see through our best efforts and get to know the real us, the flawed us, the version of us we try to push down for no one to know.

Truth is, the people who spend time with you, the people who want to love you, see through all your efforts and choose to stay with you because although your failures are exposed so are your virtues.

And we're ought to give credit to them that they are rational beings who make choices, loving us is a choice, a choice they make knowing all the bad stuff we so hard try to sweep under the rug.

723,"If a woman declines a date, please don’t try to convince her otherwise.","I was suppose to go on a date with a guy. However, our conversations via phone were very centered around him, his beliefs, mantras, self-help mentality. We had a 45 min phone call where I got away with saying “oh wow, yeah, cool” most of it and spoke up for about 10 minutes. The times I did speak, he just sounded disinterested and went back to talking. 

We were suppose to go on a date today. However, he hadn’t finalized a time and I ended up suggesting  some times. We hadn’t agreed on a place either. In general, I just wasn’t feeling a strong interest/connection for it warrant a date. So I texted a few hours ahead of suggested/non-specific meet up time saying I just wasn’t feeling it and didn’t want to waste our times (I texted it 4-5 hours ahead of the date).

The guy called 2x and texted me 4x, essentially taking my no as a starting negotiation point. He sorta mocked my reasoning saying how could say no for lack of strong connection since we’d never met. This wasn’t going to change my mind at all. 

It just frustrated me.

726,I’m tired,"Exactly what it says. I’m sick of putting forth effort getting ready for dates, dealing with anxiety over it beforehand, and worrying about whether I’m good enough before, during and after said date.

I’ll be 41 in March- which is fine- just thought at this age I’d be living the American Dream with an effing picket fence. 

It’s Friday, and here I am at 8:15pm, showered, in bed, alone, listening to a podcast while I whine to all of you poor people. Look, I’m aware I lead a privileged life. I’m a basic white girl (not into PSL’s) who doesn’t have to deal with racism, poverty, or abuse. Sure, I grew up poor, and was a victim of domestic abuse, but very quickly remedied those circumstances as an adult. 

But honestly, that bad stuff was years ago, and I thank God everyday for all the wonderful people and comforts I’m blessed to have now. 

I’m still lonely though. That hasn’t changed. I’ve been divorced for 8 years now and in this time I’ve literally been on every dating app, gone on blind dates, tried dating a couple of people from Reddit. It’s just not working.

I’m not writing this so people can point out what I’m doing wrong (“maybe you’re too fat, clingy, you need to floss more”)or to get sympathy or likes. More so writing it to reach people going through the same situation on a Friday night, wishing they had their person next to them in bed while watching some dumb movie or tv show. 

If I’m being 100% real, there are days where I have had to make peace with the idea that I might never find someone good for me. I’ll be the old lady who collects dogs instead of cats because plot twist. Next thing you know I’ll be in the nursing home at 85, and I’ll find the love of my life in room 104, but he ends up dying a week later.

Takes quite some time and unfortunately that’s stuck in my head whenever I start speaking to someone. 

I’ve had a lot of success on dating apps but I can’t help but to feel unmotivated when messaging another lady. Having to “win them over”. Having to put effort into these damn conversations with these random people online. All these steps that are usually taken when meeting someone just seems like a hassle.

728,People need to be careful about participating in casual relationships/hook-up culture,"I can't stress this enough. Every now and then, i'll come across a post of someone saying they feel 'used' and hurt after being ghosted or made distant by someone they recently had sex with. Often times, their date/fwb led them on to believe that they could have been something more by mentioning that they weren't ready for a relationship at the moment, but were open to seeing where things go. Other times, their date/fwb love-bombed them with phrases about how they see a future with them, or showed them constant affection through their actions and demonstrated genuine interest in them by getting to know them better, asking to hangout, bringing them to meet their friends, etc.  

It can be very hard to discern as to whether or not their actions are genuine, but these are manipulation tactics that are part of their game, which is to ""hit it and quit it."" They know that by feeding you with this information, they will be able to keep your feelings on a hook and achieve their end goal of having sex with you. It's completely fucked up, and in no way was this your fault as you were completely led on to believe that a serious relationship could have come out of this or were stonewalled for no clear reason after agreeing on a friends with benefits. 

However, since I've had this happen to me in the past and know many women that have gone through (can happen to men as well), I think it's important that we are more careful in participating in casual relationships/hook-up culture. If you want a serious relationship and your partner/date is telling you they are emotionally unavailable, not ready for a relationship, love-bombing you (when they barely know you), or want to see ""where things go,"" do not settle for that and move on. I promise you, this is part of their ploy and sticking around will leave you hurt - no matter how fit you think you are to be around them. On the other hand, if they are demonstrating interest in you, it's best to wait it out until you can get a better feel of them or make things official. Just remember, *only you* can protect your peace - nobody else can. If you think you are not built for a casual relationship and cannot deal with being ghosted or made distant (which happens quite a lot), it's not the best idea to participate in it yourself and that's completely fine.",vojah8,446,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vojah8/people_need_to_be_careful_about_participating_in/

He said he genuinely wants to be friends if there’s no physical chemistry and asked to change our third date to just friends hangout to talk about our first two dates as friends??? 
I don’t think not sleeping together equates no physical chemistry. If he just wants to hookup then why insist on meeting up and hangout as friends? Would you still be friends?

Edits/ Thanks for all the comments! To answer some of yalls questions, I always pay for my own drinks on dates and no alcohol on the first few dates. He was definitely a lot more touchy than most of the first dates I’ve been on, and to think back, I did not reciprocate as much. And we haven’t kissed. I can see how an insecure person would see it as rejection, therefore propose on just being friends first. I can also see he might just wants to hookup and have a foot in the door as “friends” now for later. Which I don’t think I’ll really know until we have a conversation to assess.

732,"Guy I’m dating turns off lights for sex and doesn’t initiate it, I am worried he thinks I’m unattractive?","He is 35, I am a 25 year old woman. I just started having sex after waking up from a fundamentalist Christian cult and have no experience with these things - he is my first. 

Anyway, I am admittedly pretty, and get a good amount of attention from men, but I am most definitely not teeny tiny… My body is pretty average size, small amount of flab, but my frame (bones) is med-large. Boobs, hips, waist. This guy I’m dating is pretty average too. Average frame, but he is small compared to me, being only one inch taller and generally short. Has been known to only go for hot girls I feel like I don’t compare to, though I’m overall not too insecure about my looks. He has expressed insecurity about weight gain/ his belly, but it doesn’t seem to phase him too bad. He is a confident guy.

First time we had sex - the time I lost my virginity - he turned the lights off before we started. With the exception of a time he turned the TV on before, every time since then has been the same. 

I am also always the one who initiates sex, but it could be because this is new to me and I can’t seem to get enough? I’ve brought this up and he says it’s not true, and that he always kisses me. Also not true.

He does seem to care about how I feel during sex and focuses on my pleasure/does favors, never pressures me on doing things I don’t want to, even if it means he gets no favors.

He is kind to me, texts me almost every day, pays for everything, is affectionate at times. Has said he doesn’t want to formally date - be bf & gf - just yet because he has a drinking problem he is trying to help himself with. So I am just super confused about his behavior.

Before I’m told it’s the age difference, I have to say he is pretty youthful, energetic, for being 35 and totally acts much younger.

739,How to meet girls in a socially acceptable way?,"I'll keep this short because it's similar to what many other guys face as well, but would greatly appreciate any advice! 

25 year old guy. Living in major city, attractive women all around me 24/7. I think I am decent/average looking, and a funny/cool person to spend time with, and my friends would say the same, both guy/girl. Solid career. Absolutely zero dating life. I cannot figure out how in the world to meet women in a way that isn't frowned upon.  Please see some points about options that are frequently suggested below:

\-Dating apps: I've been trying them for years. Never ever get matches/likes. I've tried everything from different photos/strategies etc. Gave them up as they hurt your psyche.

\-Going to the bars: My friend group very rarely goes to the bars, so productivity for this is too rare/slim

\-Friend group/social circle/meeting people: I have a decent group of friends. It hasn't produced anything yet. I am tired of just waiting around for a woman to just ""naturally"" be introduced to me. It just doesn't happen.

\-Through interests/hobbies/events: My interests aren't conducive to group outings/events. And I'd rather not attend events alone, that is frowned upon as a man, risking looking like a creepy loner.

\-More serious dating sites: Very few of the women that use these are 25 or under, so not a good option/not worth the effort.

\-Grocery store/coffee shop/other public place: This is my only shot I think, but I still believe it is not socially acceptable and I will be scolded for trying to meet women in a store, even if it is respectful. I don't even see this having a high success rate either though.

\-Cold approaching on street: Seems to be EXTREMELY frowned upon, and I don't want to build a reputation as the creepy dude roaming the area hitting on girls, let me know if this is wrong.

So, you can see why I am frustrated. I want things to change, I can't keep waiting around. I don't have a clue as to what I am doing wrong, seeming it is so easy and natural for other guys I know to meet women and have a strong dating life.

740,Never talking to multiple people at once again,"I spent the past month getting over a girl I was dating, we weren't exclusive, but we were exclusive... as in we both weren't seeing anyone anyways.

It ended, and everyone's advice was to see more people at once... I tried that. THAT SHIT IS EXHAUSTING!!!!

I'm extroverted as fuck too, but goddamn 7 conversations at once, different topics, different interests to remember. How the fuck do y'all do this?!

Do y'all just date as a hobby ? How am I supposed to work, go to the gym, maintain friendships and try to get to know more people?!

I ended up mixing up people's stories and got called out on it. I have good memory too, but this was embarrassing.

\----------------------------

Just adding on here

Anyways, everyone is saying ""we mean 2-3"" not 7.

LOL Yes, I get that, but like I'm already on the 2nd date with 2/7 and have had first dates with 2/7. 3 of the 7 I'm still texting. They're all honestly very pretty women, but as everyone knows being physically attractive only gets you through the front door. I'm here for something long lasting.

I'm probably going to slow fade or let the 6 of them know that I'm kinda vibing really well with someone.

This was really just an experiment with myself to see how much I can handle. During my university days when there was peer pressure to talk to multiple women it was definitely sustainable and cool but like I'm 27 nearly 28. I know myself well enough to know what I want in a person. I've literally done a lot of therapy work after my last relationship during the pandemic. I'm a Fearful Avoidant, now leaning secure.

Also, I got a mortgage in a major city, I got a great job, I coach and train brazilian jiu jitsu and have great friends. I also play golf on Sunday mornings. If I can't be myself + devote time to a potential partner then I'm not living the life I want to live. I still want to be able to do my hobbies and not sacrifice them for temporary people.

If I have to add 2-3 people into my life to not get hurt by one of the three people then that ain't right, I don't mind getting hurt by rejection it just shows how real I was in that relationship/situationship.

\-----------------------------

LOL Also, going to add this part here. A lot of you guys are thinking I'm humble bragging. I get it, it looks like that for sure.

I'm just trying to show you, that just because you can afford to talk to multiple people that life isn't ""better"" I'm a pretty empathetic dude in touch with his emotions and now I have 6 women that I'll have to end things with, that shit hurts me too. They're all great but I just liked one of them a lot more. (she got nice eyes and a laugh that makes me laugh, we also have the same humor)

Nevertheless, it's going to suck having to tell 6 people that hey I'm seeing someone else ... after we've been vibing really well for the past 2-3 weeks.

Talking with MULTIPLE people feels like a broken record repeating the same thing about yourself. Do you know how much I hate repeating the same story lol it seems so surface level to me and there's way more to a person than just those typical surface level questions. I REALLY like to get to know someone, like what makes them tick and why they became the person they are and I like to share that part of me as well. 

Also, I'm not some super good looking fella lol I think the rateme subreddit gave me a 7.8 or something but I've seen some ugly folks get a 7 too so take that with a grain of salt I guess.

742,I think a little clingyness is ok,"I know you all are probably thinking ""what the hell is this guy talking about"". But please hear or read me out. I personally don't mind a woman who is clingy some of the time. Cuz to me, it shows she cares deeply about me and my wellbeing. I like being checked on or asked how I'm feeling. I don't mind lots of calls or texts when there's free time available for me. Obviously with anything good, balance is key.

 To me, i like knowing that someone is thinking about me as much as i am about them. Yes i may have a little clingy tendencies myself but i call it having lots of care for someone. Anyways just thought i share this and let people know in some cases it's ok to be a little clingy because hey everyone likes different things in a partner. Thanks for reading and enjoy your day.

745,Inexperienced new partner (M) seems to need a lot of coaching,"Met a guy (M, early 30s) who only ever had one sexual partner in his lifetime due to committing to a long-term relationship early on which recently ended. As a result, he is caring, but incredibly vanilla, easily impressed, and shy in bed. He is rather passive, too. I’m walking a fine line between blowing his mind and weirding him out with the most mundane stuff. I have to direct him a good lot of the time as well.

It feels like I’d need to defile this poor man’s soul just to get him up to speed. Maybe he wouldn’t even mind that down the line, but I can already tell that I’m not so thrilled about the dynamics of having to teach him while enduring lukewarm sex for what might take some time. If the sex stayed at this quality permanently, it would not be acceptable to me. Any advice? Should I even bother? Is someone like him even likely to take to bedroom lessons if you will?

749,Guy told me “the stars aren’t aligning right” when I said I didn’t want to have sex or fool around,"Ok, my edits have gotten outta control. I can’t help it. Sorry. The only part you’ll prob ever really need to read is the actual original post, seriously.

————————

So this guy I’d been dating for like a minute tells me he doesn’t want to hang out when I explicitly tell him I’d like to hang out with him but no funny business of any kind that night. I said I didn’t want to go to his home with the pressure of knowing he might want more (we had fooled around before) so I just wanted to be clear that while I wanted to hang out, I didn’t want to do more. He then tells me it seems we aren’t on the same page so best not to hang out. He said he was a physical person so he would want to cuddle with me but if I didn’t then best not to come over. I reply saying that I did want to hang out, that I was interested in him and that cuddling and kissing is fine. I just didn’t want to go further than that that night. He then says, looks like the stars aren’t aligning tonight between us so let’s try again next time. I ask what he means by that and we get into some sort of an argument because he tells me I’m being controlling by imposing boundaries before even coming over. Needless to say we are no longer seeing each other and I think he’s a jerk. But… I’m curious to see what others think. Any perspective I should consider? I ask only because while I know this will prob make him sound like a jerk I must admit that wanting just sex (which might’ve been where he was at) isn’t inherently bad. Also, setting up boundaries is good and healthy but it CAN come across as controlling. So I just wanted to see if there was another way to look at this.

—————-

EDIT: Guys, seriously (for some commentators, only) the problem is NOT that he wanted sex and I didn’t. In fact, we can assume that by the context but we can’t say that for sure because HE NEVER SAID THAT, which is part of the problem. The problem (and reason why I posted this) is that he was not honest about just wanting sex, was saying all he wanted was to cuddle (in response to me saying I didn’t want sex) and yet when I was like, ok let’s just cuddle, he says no and calls me controlling for trying to lay out rules for how the night should go. THAT IS THE PROBLEM. So if we are to assume that all he wanted was sex (which I’d say is a safe assumption) then I personally think it’s messed up to NOT SAY THAT but then call me controlling when I SAY the opposite (that I didn’t want sex then). It’s really not that hard to understand. Good lord.

I think some people are blind to the actual issue because they’re too stuck on the idea that some women get upset when some men just want sex. Why don’t you just read the post and take it for what it is instead of making assumptions based on gender relations stereotypes?

————————-

EDIT 2: Alright, fine. If it helps, here’s more or less how the dialogue went:

Him: “I just wanna cuddle with you”

Me: “cool, just no sex and clothes on”

Him: “nah, you know what, we aren’t on the same page then”

Me: “why? Because I don’t want to have sex?”

Him: “oh, no, not that. I just think you’re being controlling”

Me: “why? Because I’m being upfront about my boundaries?”

Him: “no, because you’re telling me how the night is gonna go before you even get here. Plus I’m a physical person and I don’t wanna run the risk of doing something you don’t want me to do”

Me: “so I guess it’s a good thing I’m telling you exactly what I don’t want! Now let’s cuddle like you said you wanted.”

Him: “nah, the stars aren’t aligning tonight. Let’s try another time.”

😶

Then some arguing ensues. 🤷‍♀️

—————————

Edit 3: ok, so it’s been about 7 hours since I posted this and here is where I’m at (PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK. IT’S LONG 😄):

1) I feel uncomfortable saying that he 100% just wanted sex because he never actually said that. HOWEVER, I’m fairly certain that’s a huge factor. (more about that on point 4)

2) If im going to assume that all he wanted was sex, then while it is true that there is a small portion of me (we are talking like, 10% of me) thinking that makes him a dick (it doesn’t) due to the culture/ environment I grew up in, I ultimately DO NOT think him or ANYONE just wanting sex is a jerk because that’s all they want.

3) So, if I’m going to assume that all he wanted was sex and if that’s not an actual problem (because it isn’t) then what makes him a jerk is the fact that he wasn’t upfront and 100% honest about it. And no, acting like all you want is sex does not equate to actually being honest about it. Actually being honest about it and saying exactly what you want is what equates to well, being honest about it. 

4) It took me thinking about this situation from the day I met him to this very last interaction as I read and replied to comments to understand that the main issue here as I see it is how controlling *he is*. Now, it won’t make sense to most people here because they don’t know him and didn’t interact with him but I picked up on that based on comments he made about past gfs. Then the interaction described above ensued and I focused on the whole “should I have said anything about not wanting sex/is he right to call me controlling” part. When in reality, it’s likely not about sex. Well, I’m sure that’s part of it but certainly not entirely about it. The fact is (in my opinion anyways) that this man wants to be the one calling the shots in the relationship. So it’s an immediate turn off for him when someone comes along and says, “here is my line, do not cross it”. Sure he wants to have sex so it sucked to hear that that wasn’t gonna happen. But it’s more than that. Because I also know for a fact that he WAS looking for a relationship. Ok, maybe not for a fact but based on things I picked up on I feel confident to say that. So, when he called me controlling when I obv wasn’t being, he was actually projecting.

5) We met at a speed dating event then went on one date. Without any explanation he messages me later in the week saying we should call it off because we wanted different things. Thing is, I had never said what I wanted nor had he. But he chose to decide what I wanted for himself and called it off. Ok. Then a month later I get in touch with him saying let’s just be friends and he agrees but starts flirting with me and I’m like… well, ok, I’m fine with that too. 🤷‍♀️ So, we fool around a couple of times then after that is when the interaction above happens. SOOOOO, things def got messed up when we started going out again without an actual conversation about what we were doing. The reason why this wasn’t included on my original post is because there is only so much detail you can include before the post is too damn long. BESIDES, this background info is not entirely relevant since my focus was on the actual question: “is it controlling to give a heads up about not wanting sex” and “is this guy’s reaction to my saying that douchy?” Because, truth be told, he could’ve right there and then said something like: “look, I don’t think we are a match as a couple but I’m down to hookup if you are, if not that’s cool but best if we don’t hang out then”. No, instead he chose to pretend he “just wanted cuddling” 🙄 and turned it on me and called me controlling. Why? Because he wanted sex and was pissed? Sure. But ALSO because he’s manipulative and did not like the fact that if we ever embarked on a relationship, there was gonna be no room for him to be controlling/calling the shots like he most likely had done in the past.

6) I’ve been told I’m argumentative. Yes. I am. Part of it is me not being the kind of person who will put up with shit. Part of it is me being too smart for my own good. And part of it is me being a flawed human being. Mostly, I’m proud of who I am and won’t apologize for it.

7) ANY AND EVERY REASON IS A LEGITIMATE REASON FOR SOMEONE NOT WANTING SEX AND NO ONE IS OWED AN EXPLANATION WHY. Don’t disappoint us, boys!

Anyways, thanks for all of the comments but I think I have reached the verdict and some of you have def helped. Some others… well, not so much but thanks for playing! 😀

——————————

Edit 4: One of the reasons I posted this was to see what others thought about my choice to be very clear, over text, prior to meeting the guy (for what would be the 5th time) that I was not going to have sex with him or do anything other than cuddling/kissing if he wanted. I know it’s an unusual thing to do/say so I wanted to see how it came across to others and see if there was any reasonable argument against it. Sadly, there wasn’t.

Telling me “that’s a turn off for the guy” and “you should just go with the flow” is positively not a good counterpoint. I’ll go with whatever flow *I am* comfortable with at my own pace and if that’s a turn off for the guy then it just means we aren’t a match, no harm done. Well, not unless you disguise your intentions like the guy here and then retaliate when disappointed. And it’s SO SAD to see how quite a few “gentlemen” here simply cannot see that. I blame the parents! Lol

Also, “I would rather be told no in person” = “I wanna be able to hope to have sex till the very last minute and be given the opportunity to try to get what I want because you know, that matters more than the girl knowing what she wants. Plus I don’t wanna have my hopes crushed because that hurst my pride 😭😭” 🤦‍♀️ Seriously, guys? Next thing I’m gonna hear is that I’m required to put out if the guy tells me he has blue balls because the “poor thing, how about his needs? Don’t they matter (read matter more)?” Honestly I hope lots of young women read this and see it as a warning.

Also, WOMEN DO NOT CONTROL SEX. Guys are just as welcome to say no as the girl is. It’s no woman’s fault if lots of guys are always up for sex. Maybe be more selective folks, that way you’ll have a sense of control if that’s what you want. 🤷‍♀️",s9jxo1,429,453,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/s9jxo1/guy_told_me_the_stars_arent_aligning_right_when_i/
750,"She texted shes looking forward to first date because its a nice ""treat"" after work... Whats that mean?","Don't have much experience at 29 and but this the first time in a LONG time I've really felt a connection with a girl and i'm nervous. I'll be fine when i get there but man the anticipation... Its almost too good to be true, she's smart, pretty, athletic, seems very nice and family orientated, has a good job..

I told her I'm looking forward to meeting her and she said ""me too, it will be a nice treat after working all day""... She actually messaged me first as soon as we matched.

Not sure how it went, she was actually sort of awkward, tense and uptight but friendly, she honestly seems really similar to me.

Anyways I think she asked the waiter for the bill when she got up. She offered to split, I paid and she asked what my plans where for later... I said nothing and she said she had to get going to study for her promotion.

I know she's been studying a lot and is overwhelmed and tired. But it left me confused, she thanked me for the dinner I said maybe we can do it again and she said yes, in a couple weeks after the exam.  We walked back to our cars, no hugs but she said thanks and get home safe.  I'll text her today saying it was nice meeting you. I'm not to crazy about the way it ended.

751,"How someone behaves when they are attracted to you will vary greatly, don't be so quick to assume one way or the other","The internet is full of advice about how to spot when someone is or is not attracted to you by how they behave, whilst some of these may be real indicators of their attraction (or lack of) towards you, don't assume that everyone will act the same way, because they don't, and they make act in the total opposite of what you might expect. 

We are each unique individuals with our own view of the world, of ourselves and of others, these variances will influence how someone behaves towards you. Some people are extremely confident and self-assured, they may make their attraction towards you obvious, as they do not fear love or the potential rejection as much as others. Some people may have a hard time trusting people, they fear love and the potential heartbreak that comes with it, they may lack self-esteem and believe that they are not worthy of love, therefore they reject themselves, inadvertently rejecting everyone else.

We are complex and many people can feel wildly different levels of confidence in different aspects of their life, such as work, personal relationships, hobbies etc. Just because someone may appear to be confident on the surface in one context, they may completely lack this in another, again changing how they behave, making it more difficult to interpret their behaviour. 

Your own views of yourself will greatly distort how you interpret someone else's behaviour. If you're insecure and have low self-esteem, you may assume the worst interpretation of people's behaviour, as you may not feel worthy of or trust in someone's love for you. Someone with a more stable level of self-esteem may have a more realistic and rational interpretation of other people's behaviour, and regardless of how someone treats them they still maintain their sense of self-worth. 

Ultimately you cannot control or fully understand other people's behaviour, you can only control yourself and your own perceptions of your worth. This will dictate how you interact with those you are attracted to and what you will tolerate from others.",sw8tn2,416,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sw8tn2/how_someone_behaves_when_they_are_attracted_to/
752,"I had a really nice date, but he lied about his height","I (25F) am 5'0"" and height doesn't matter to me. I'd date a guy shorter than me. It's just not a factor in attraction for me, never has been.

That said, I matched with a guy(27M) on Hinge and we had pretty good conversation. We finally went on a date yesterday. It was an amazing time. We watched Netflix, played games, made out, and I spent the night at his place. Things got pretty heated, but I told him I didn't want to go further than touching over clothes, and he was very reassuring that that's fine with him. He never tried to pressure me or go further than I was comfortable with. He was attentive and made me feel safe. He texted me shortly after I left, and it's definitely been one of my better first dates.

However, just now I was looking over his profile and I saw he stated his height is 5'10"". I instantly felt pretty down because it's obviously not true. He can't be taller than 5'5"", maybe 5'6"" at best.

Not sure how to proceed. I enjoy his personality, and he's great at cuddling. I feel like we have decent chemistry together. On one hand, I know a lot of guys lie about their height, but on the other, I still hate that he did, especially by this many inches. If he lies about this, what else is he comfortable lying about?

I don't want to drop him over this. I still want to go on a second date with him. But it just feels really disappointing, and I'm not sure what I should do.

**Edit**: It seems some people are really struggling to understand this, so I would like to explain it for you guys. I do not care  about height. I care about **lying** about height. Yes, I would have still matched him if his profile listed him as 5'5"". No, I'm not lying about this. And no, I'm not claiming I'm the norm. I do understand that many woman would have passed on him, and I do understand that's likely why he felt the need to lie.

754,Told a guy to stop dry texting me. Was I rude?,"A guy from college approached me asking to go out with him multiple times and I said yes but due to Covid and online classes we’re both stuck in 2 different cities. We’ve been texting on and off for 3-4 months. He’s a trust-fund baby and has everything laid out to him on a platter - I initially overlooked his dry texting because people told me he’s just a bit aloof in general because he never really had to work for anything and therefore doesn’t put any effort into getting people or things. 

He gradually started opening up more but I noticed that most of the time it’s me trying to find new topics to talk about and ask him questions. I tried to end the conversations many a times because of how dry they got, to a point where I’d even say “good night. Seems like you’re busy, im going to bed” but he’d stop the conversation from ending by asking me to talk to him but wouldn’t put in the effort to say anything after - it would be me asking him questions again. The other day he asked me about my day and after I explained it to him, he replied “nice.” That was the last straw, I was so pissed so I told him “if you don’t have more than a word to say, just don’t text at all. Leave my message on read because frankly I don’t know what to reply to such texts.” 

The text sounded perfectly normal in my head but he got offended by it and even my friends told me that it’s a tad bit rude. I regretted it and apologised to him and we haven’t spoken since because he’s still mad about it. Do you think I did anything wrong? Was it rude to call him out? Should I have been subtle about it?

761,How to let girl down after awful sex?,"I 26M met this girl 29F on Bumble a couple days ago, had good natural conversation, so we decided to meet up for a couple of drinks last night. Honestly she looked even better in person, conversation flowed naturally again and we both enjoyed ourselves. As we were leaving the bar she asked if I wanted to hang at her place for a little but said she wasn’t going to sleep with me, so I said sure. A little into our show she starts to get touchy feely, we start to kiss but it just wasn’t flowing at all, she then pulls my junk out and tries to give me head but it was no joke the worst I’ve ever experienced, by far, and the sex was no better. She couldn’t make me finish so I just had to jerk myself off at the end. Don’t know if she was just inexperienced or what, but as a guy with high sexual needs I know this won’t work. Thing is she’s texting me the next day and I don’t know how to let her down easily without hurting her feelings, and obviously I don’t wanna tell her she was bad?",w6d5ja,414,165,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/w6d5ja/how_to_let_girl_down_after_awful_sex/
762,I made terrible mistake.,"I've meet this girl on tinder, we exchanged numbers and texted for a while. When it was time to get on a date, we've meet, and in all honesty she doesn't look anything like the pics(only face pics and that's about it, that should be my first red flag) . She has beautiful face, but oh my God she is quite a bit overweight, her nails are long unkeept(not girly like, full on long and dirty), her hair unkeept, her personality is food and only food, she doesn't work, stay awake until 5 am on tiktok and sleeps until noon. You can see that she is quite depressed. I am not the jackpot myself, but i train, i am deecent looking guy, i have deecent job, and at least i think i am funny. 

And that would be it for me the moment i saw her, i would have turned arround and left, but the girl has cutting scars on her arms and recent, and i do not know how to end it with her, since i saw those scars, comapsionate side of me, or somethig fucking else turned on, i went on with the date. on her side it went well, since i was basicaly just being myself and tried my best to get in the friend zone, but no. At the end of the date she hugged me and actually kissed me, and texted me she can't wait for the next date to just be kissing. 

I don't want to continue to see this girl, like at all. But i don't want to be an asshole and just ghost her, or broke off with her via text, since  i am affraid, that she might do something to herself. 

Basicaly i've fucked up masively.

Also i apologize for any mistakes, English is not my first language.

Update: she agreed to stay friends after a lot guilt tripping and sobs how no one ever is gonna love her and how i am guilty of her mental state. She has calmed down.",ypeoio,411,202,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ypeoio/i_made_terrible_mistake/
763,Do women fantasize about men?,"I started dating a wonderful girl and I really like her, she hasn't been in a relationship before and because she hadn't even thought of being into one it was kinda alien to her, that's why she took quite some time to want to date ""officially"". Now, at first I just wanted to cuddle with her and kiss her, now I want more advanced stuff as well but very slowly to not scare her. I started fantasizing about her and she is really giving me a libido but she is very attractive compared to me, do you think that she fantasizes about doing sexual stuff with me as well? I have a very handsome face but I am a bit fat something that I consider that it would be quite a turn off when I think that she might be fantasizing.

764,How do people do this and not feel empty?,"I've had two short-lived this summer, both ending in disappointment. I only saw each of them for about six weeks, so it's not like we had integrated our lives, but I was struck by how much like a break up the end of these brief relationships felt, I don't understand how this seems to be so routine for people. You meet someone, there's a connection, and then you spend time learning about their lives and their families and friends. You learn how they laugh and what kind of foods they like or dislike. You get to know the layouts of their living spaces and the view from their windows. You become accustomed to their mannerisms. You walk beside them and lay hands on them in idle moments and see how their eyes change when they're happy or upset or feeling somehow weak.

And then there's a strange distance and they don't text often or smile when they see you, and soon you're sitting across a table at some local coffee shop hearing that you want different things or that you're not compatible.  They are gone and now you're stuck with this attachment that suddenly feels inappropriate but didn't feel at all strange as it developed, while they grow farther away with each passing day they don't reach out. 

Is this just me? How do people just go in and out of people's lives like this without feeling the way I do, watching them fade in and suddenly vanish?",x3zdrk,410,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/x3zdrk/how_do_people_do_this_and_not_feel_empty/
765,"He wasn't ready for a relationship, so I walked away (and regret it)","I (29F) have been seeing a guy (43M) that I really liked for a little over two months now. Seeing each other almost weekly, talking or texting every other day. But he warned me early on that he wasn't ready for a relationship right now. I was in full agreement that I just wanted to get to know him and see where things go. 

But two months later, I realized I liked him a lot. I broke things off with any existing ""friends with benefits"" and turned down a lot of great (albeit not perfectly compatible) men. 

Admittedly, I am not good at relationships. I genuinely have not seen a future with someone in two years and sadly that also didn't transpire into an actual relationship. Also within the past two years, I have had one guy who I was casually dating actually *die from a heart attack* (in his early 40s) shortly after we took a vacation together. Another one turned out to be physically abusive. I took time after both of these incidents, have had ""healthy"" but short relationships that ended amicably. I am in therapy, I have a kickass career, and a great friend group. I can honestly say I am happy and doing everything ""right."" **I am ready for a partner.**



So when I started to have feelings for this guy, I tried to keep my barriers up, knowing he wasn't ready, but he was putting up his own barriers. I can't talk to him about any of the relatively minor challenges in my life because he ""can't handle it"" on top of the challenges in his life. Despite me wanting to be there for him, to support and listen to him as any good *partner* would. 

I acknowledge and respect where his priorities are right now, but **I want to be someone's priority.** I want to make them my priority. I want a partner because I finally feel like I have a good grasp on what that means. It's not abnormal to want these things, and yet I have been made to feel that way. 

I was beginning to feel really comfortable with him. The chemistry, the sex, the shared interests, and the laughter made me feel on top of the world when I was with him. And it was only getting better. But when he wanted to reschedule our date on Saturday night at the very last minute, I simply said that my time was too valuable for this. 

He called me, and I hate how I reacted. I didn't want to hear how he wasn't ready again. I certainly didn't want to hear that his ex had been reaching out to him but that he has all these feelings for me. I finally asked if he could give me anything, just a simple ""I want you"" or ""I want to see where this is going"" but I just got radio silence. And so I said, ""I've given you every chance I could,"" and hung up. 

Although logically I think it was the right thing to do, I've felt physically sick since doing it. I hate that I pressured him, that I interrupted the (slow, but good) trajectory we were on. I don't know how to come back from this - I think it's up to him - but I wish more than anything I would see his stupid name flash on my phone again. 

How can I be grieving a relationship that never even started? Do I just have to start from scratch all over again, having ruined all the other possibilities immediately available to me? 

**What did I do wrong, and how do I not repeat this same scenario again?**

We don’t have sex much but we cuddle a lot. We spend the whole night in each other’s arms, he kisses my forehead, we bought each other Christmas presents, we laugh so much together, etc.

However, he also says that he doesn’t love himself at the moment, which doesn’t make it possible for him to love someone else. He says he blocks himself from feeling, basically.

780,"If someone ghosts you, it’s not because they are intimidated by you, or they don’t have time for a personal life. They’re simply not interested. Don’t let your ego get in the way of seeing reality for what it is","Sometimes when we get rejected, we’ll try to rationalize, or come up with excuses why the other person suddenly removed themselves from our lives.

This is normal.  We don’t want to believe that someone simply doesn’t want us to be a part of their life—it’s particularly difficult when things are seemingly going well, and the contact suddenly stops. We will often come up with scenarios that are meant to protect our ego, but are removed from reality.

It’s never a good idea to get emotionally attached to someone you just met, or a ‘friend’ that you’ve never been in a relationship with. Placing romantic hopes prematurely on someone can lead to unhealthy emotional attachment, and actually finding someone that wants to be with you.

If someone is into you, they will typically make it easier for you to see them. If they limit or remove communication, it typically means that they have lost interest. They aren’t distancing themselves because they’re afraid of being hurt, or that you’re such an amazing person that they don’t want to ultimately lose you. It doesn’t work that way.

These type of thoughts are defense mechanisms for our feelings and ego. Experiencing rejection is never easy, but ignoring reality will possibly prevent you from focusing on meeting those who actually wan to be with you and make you a priority. If you rationalize your rejection, it will allow you to hold onto false hope and wait for that person to reach out again.

Even if they do, do you want to be with someone who disregards your feelings to such an extent. Your self respect and time are far more important than engaging with someone who doesn’t value you.",u8n78j,394,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/u8n78j/if_someone_ghosts_you_its_not_because_they_are/

She’s not my girlfriend, and she knows this. We’re not exclusive (and I’ve heard women saying that it’s okay to keep seeing other people until you’re in a a relationship). But for some reason, I also feel a pang of guilt over this. What should I do?

Also, she told me it’s been about a year since she did anything with a guy, so I’m guessing she’s not seeing anyone else.

789,Date gave me mixed signals and wants nothing to do with me,"I went on a date last night and everything went better then expected. To make a long story short, we started making out in my car and everything started to get sexual between us. so we headed back to her place and she immediately gets undressed in front of me while I did the same. We started to fool around a bit but she suddenly stops and tells me “I don’t have sex on the first date.” I was taken back by this but I immediately respected her boundaries and stopped pursuing sex from her. We only cuddle for the rest of the time I was there. It wasn’t until I had to leave she aggressively jumped on me and started to grind on my crotch. I jokingly told her “are you trying to give me blue balls?” and she seemed annoyed and irritated after I said that. So I kissed her goodbye and went back home. She was eager to see me again so we made plans for a second date. Once I got home she completely switched up on me for no reason. Telling me that she’s “on the fence about everything” and “sometimes it’s not meant to be” without any explanation. I politely asked if I did anything to make her feel uncomfortable and she left me on read. So I texted her again an hour later and asked if we could talk about what went wrong. She immediately responded with “fuck off, I’m not interested anymore.” I was heartbroken by this message especially after having an amazing first date with this woman. It was extremely rude of her to respond to me like that and could have easily told me what I did wrong and why she decided to not see me anymore. So I blocked her and left it alone. I just don’t understand what I did wrong to make her feel that way. I respected her boundaries when she changed her mind about having sex. I just don’t know anymore. Any suggestions and advice on this topic would be very helpful.

Our first interactions started on Instagram, and we’d just be casually sending memes, but eventually met up by coincidence in person at a local show (we both do music in the diy scene), and since then we’ve been in contact alot more. We’ve gone out a couple times, and the first time he admitted to having a crush on me, saying he hoped it wouldn’t make things weird between us. We went out again yesterday, and he said I was very cute. In addition to his comments, he asked me out on an official date, and I just responded with a “maybe”. He’s really nice, I enjoy his company, and he treats me well. It does feel a little weird knowing he’s much older than me, but I do share an attraction to him as well. However, I’ve been having many conflicting emotions about pursuing anything with D, mainly because of the gap in maturity and power dynamic between us. I don’t have very much life experience, and I’m also concerned about the reasons as for why he would choose to pursue me at all. I really like him, but I still feel like I’m barely transitioning from a kid to an adult, and I’m unsure as to what steps to take next. I wouldn’t want anything serious tbh, but would I still be setting myself up for failure?

I’d say we were moving pretty slow the part few months bc of her school so we saw each other just once a month until now, mostly bc she said she was focusing on her semester which i didn’t mind and promised that she would hang more once the semester is over.

She asked me about my past and i said i’ve only slept with 2 girls. and then i asked the last time she had sex. And this is where she revealed to me that she had sex at a hotel with her FWB of a year now(how long their relationship has been going on). Not gonna lie i was shocked like felt sick to my stomach. i know we weren’t exclusive and all that but i feel like she lied to me about this whole thing. i’ve been debating on ending things with her bc it dosent sit right with me.

805,How to introduce my black girlfriend to my traditionalist indian parents?,"So I (M26) have been dating my girlfriend (F28) for about 9 months now and things are starting to get serious. We’re actually starting to talk about introducing to each others families officially. I’m not worried about meeting her family but my parents are Indian immigrants who have some pretty backwards views on interracial relationships. My whole life growing up one of their greatest fears was that I would marry a non-indian girl, and they reinforced this to me constantly telling me that they would find an indian bride for me or not to marry white/black/chinese (literally anyone non-indian) etc. I understand what their concern, it’s not a thing rooted racism, it’s rooted in protectionism. They want to ensure that their culture and their traditions carry on. And the only way they see that happening is if I’m with an indian girl. 

But the thing they just don’t get, is that I’m not an Indian. I’m an American who has Indian heritage. They just can’t wrap their heads around the idea that their culture and their traditions don’t mean the same thing to me that it means to them. 

So now I’m basically gearing up for a fight against my parents. I know they won’t change their minds, they’re old and set in their ways.

I have a history of casual sex but don't exactly feel as comfortable with it now that I'm older. I've realized that I don't know how to hold back but would like to learn to. 


For example, if I'm on a date with a man and there's a connection, I might give them a kiss on the first date. If we go on a date that ends with us going to one or the others house, I have sex with them - whether I really want to or not. It's like if someone offers me chocolate and I wasn't really planning on eating chocolate: ill still eat the chocolate. I can't turn the candy down. I literally don't know how to. I don't know how to handle the situation when the kissing gets hot and heavy, how to stop at making out, how to remove myself from the situation without escalating to sex. 


Then later, I feel disappointed in myself and like I should have waited longer to allow me and my date to get to know each other better before having sex.

811,Don’t send that “I miss you” or anything trying to get them back. They don’t care,"I realized this three weeks ago. A girl I was seeing (stopped talking almost 2 months ago) would send me messages from time to time and would send me “I miss you”, “doing this reminded me of you”, “watching this show made me think of you” and so on. And as fucked up as this sounds I realized I really did not care. But I did feel sorry and bad for her because she’s an amazing person and we didn’t work out not because of anything she did but because it just wasn’t there for me.

Now I had been hung up on my ex, the relationship ended 4 years ago. I had all these ideas of sending her a long message and trying to win her back this summer. Mind you I haven’t even spoken to her whatsoever since we broke up. Talk about delusional. Anyway as I laid in bed thinking about how I really felt nothing when I received those sweet messages from the girl I thought to myself “oh my fucking god, that would be exactly how my ex would feel if I tried to win her back”. And ever since that realization that it really is over and nothing I do or say will make her care or want to be with me again I barely think about her and I’ve completely removed the idea of ever trying to win her back.

So have self respect and don’t send such messages. The person just feels sorry for you more than anything.

Another thing. The first girl I mentioned sent me a long message last week basically saying she’s realized she lost herself clinging onto me, trying to talk to me when it was obvious I didn’t really want to, and how she lost her pride doing that. And that she’s finally done and will be deleting my number. That message made me feel something, it made me happy for her because I knew she wasn’t acting like the strong, smart, and ambitious woman I had first met. She’s way too good and a catch to have acted that way and so are you.

1) teenagers (13,14, 15,16,) no you are not mature for your age,  how I know that? I was age your once and trust me no guy/girl (aged 20+) who has a right mind will date you just because you are special, they choose you guys because you can be easily manipulated and gaslighted. 
You ask yourself if you are 20+ year old will you even think of dating 13-16 yr olds? (13-16 ) year olds are basically kids. 
2) age group from (17-20) please don't date guys/girls more than 5 years older than you, no a (30-40) and (40-50)year old is not interested in you because you are mature for your age. It creates a lot of power imbalance in a relationship.

TEENAGERS PLEASE DONT DATE PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER THAN 5 -7 YEARS OF YOUR AGE.

Edit1: I have seen 3-4 posts today only asking variations of the same question ""Is it ok to date a 30+ old man when I am 18 year old""

Edit2: I basically wanted to say all the teenagers please be careful about dating men/women who are way older than you.
When people get older it's ok to have large age gaps. 
But when you are 14 and dating a 25 year old, there is a very high chance of abuse.

I graduated from a top university and grad school, have a great job, volunteer, in fantastic shape, good style, have one or two hobbies I'm really passionate about etc. It's very difficult to succeed in my industry without having a decent amount of emotional intelligence, and I have a good circle of male and female friends, so I don't think my social skills are the problem. I was also in a relationship for 1.5 years in college that went pretty well, and primarily ended because we moved to different cities post-graduation - so I don't think I'm entirely clueless with women. However, the past few years have primarily given me very little interest from women organically despite my best efforts, and terrible luck on dating apps. I've been on 5 or 6 dates in the same number of years.

Unfortunately, I'm just not particularly physically attractive - I'm around 5'8 and probably a 4/10. I'm totally confident in myself and not particularly insecure. I've certainly developed crushes on people I wasn't initially interested in physically, and I'm sure the same can happen for me. Some people just aren't physically attractive right off the bat - and I'm okay with that.     

I do currently make mid-six figures, so whilst I'm not on Elon Musk or NBA level money, I live very comfortably and that's attractive to many people. I've tried subtly 'flashing' this on dating apps to boost my profile a little, and the results aren't fantastic. It tends to attract a lot of people who are a little bit older than me and coming out of failed relationships (divorce, single parent etc.) and are looking for a 'safe' option. No offense at all to people belonging to that demographic - they deserve love - I just think we are in different stages of life. 

In any event, during an internet binge I ended up coming across a 'sugar daddy' dating website. I made a free account, and I'm now seriously considering upgrading to premium to message people properly.  If people are primarily attracted to my money, I'm struggling to argue against myself as to why I shouldn't date young, attractive women - some of whom could make good use of it with education and business ideas and what not.  
However, I'm slightly hesitant. If I were to be in a vanilla relationship in the future, I believe in being completely honest with my partner. If past relationships were to come up, I could certainly see a sugar relationship being a deal-breaker or point of contention for many women - especially as many arrangements are essentially sex work. I'm not opposed to developing a deep relationship/marriage with someone I had a sugar relationship with, but I feel like that's rare. I'd really like to have a family one day.

Does anyone have any opinions on my situation? I'm craving affection at the moment, but concerned that I'm harming (potentially non-existent) dating prospects in the future.

822,"I am so bothered with what I did this summer and thankful that I ended it. But, I’m still confused if I did the right thing.","Hello! I am 22F and been serving in a Catholic youth organization for 2 years now. I love doing services most especially in the music ministry. Two years ago when I became active in the org, I met a guy when we played an online game and a few months after that, we chatted a lot for 4 months (he’s still single when we were actively chatting). Let’s name him Matt. We have a lot of common interests and we clicked. I liked Matt but when I knew that he already got a girlfriend, I stopped chatting him and he didn’t also bothered to chat me so as his sister in our org (we call each other brothers and sisters), I just wished him a happy relationship and moved on. 

This year, he broke up with his gf. Face-to-face activities are already incorporated in our org so we get to see each other more often. We serve together in the Music team and I enjoyed our service so much. Last month I was in so much stress because of academics, mental health, and personal problems and I was not in a good place. It affected my prayer time and my spiritual life yet I’m still active in serving the org. Tbh I’m serving yet my soul feels so empty like I don’t feel God at all last month. I became so close with Matt and I can really sense that he likes me. He’s going out of his way to bring me food at night when I’m hungry, fetches and brings me home safely when I’m out late at night for study sessions, accompanies me in my late night study sessions on Discord, and helped me look for dorms that I would stay in because I moved out of my previous one. Overall he’s been super helpful and thoughtful to me that even when I didn’t ask for anything, he knows what I need and want at that instant and he would make an effort to give it to me. One night, he brought ice cream to me and took me for a stroll after that. Then a little later in our stroll, he suddenly confessed to me that he already liked me 2 years ago but was not able to confess it because he’s still trying to know me better. When he got a gf last year, he was not into her at all and was forced to be in the relationship to not hurt her feelings. I knew about this and I lost interest so I stopped chatting him. They broke up after a month, then 2 months after he got a new gf and they lasted for a year, and last month they just broke up and now he wants to pursue me. 

I’m so foolish because I also confessed to him and also got along with his kiss. Then few days after that we committed pre-marital sex, which is very quick for us to do and very wrong (we’re Catholics so it’s a sin to have pre-marital sex). I told him that we’re not going to be in a relationship right after this because I’m not ready yet and it’s discouraged in our org to be in a relationship with a brother/sister (they support relationships but you will not be assigned a bigger responsibility… but we both have a big responsibility already in the org so having a relationship is highly discouraged for us). After a month of our summer love affair, I ended it because I don’t really feel good about it, I’m so guilty, and I don’t think it would build a healthy and strong relationship for us. I told him to stop communicating with me and if we are in service together, we just keep it civil and act like nothing happened between us. Then he told me that he loves me and he’s respecting my decision. He’s hoping that someday, we would not see each other like brother and sister anymore, but more than that. He understood that the way we started is wrong and too fast, but he said he’s very sincere with me and wished he could be with me sooner. I’m in love with him too but I really have to do this because it doesn’t feel right. I’m glad that he didn’t really chat and bothered me, I guess he really respected my decision. I don’t know if he’s really sincere or maybe he was just doing it to get in my pants but all I care about is, did I do the right thing? To end us immediately because it doesn’t feel right to me? I am quite worried that he would not look at me the same way as before, but I’m more worried with how I look in God’s eyes. I’m not even sure that I’m going to end up with him, yet I already had sex with him. I am also asking for tips on how I could get through this. I am trying to reconnect myself with my spiritual life and waiting for a confession schedule yet I’m in a state of confusion and regret right now.

827,Why do guys not ask questions….,"Most dating app conversations are one sided. I ask a question, they answer. I ask another question, they answer. They don’t even say “how about you?” a lot of the time - which I feel like is pretty easy to ask so that you can mutually get to know each other. 

This has happened on dates too. A guy I recently dated for about 6 months almost NEVER asked me questions about myself, yet acted really into me. On dates I would ask about his work, his friends, how things are going in his life. Absolutely not ONE question like that back to me. I would have to just offer up information about myself without being prompted which I don’t really like doing. I want someone who will share in things that are going on in my life. I broke up with him and we didn’t talk for a while, but then I gave him a second chance because he kept pursuing me. During the time that we weren’t talking I got hired for a new job and started a side business. He didn’t ask me one thing about how I’ve been since we last talked, so he has no idea. I tried talking a little bit about how things were going at work and he just sat there totally silent. No conversing or input on how I was feeling. It’s like talking to myself. Needless to say won’t be dating him again.

Is this just a “normal” man thing? I’ve dated women in the past and it was never like this. My ex (female) always cared so much about me and every single day would ask how my day went and truly CONVERSED with me about it. She knew every single thing about me. I want that kind of love again.

841,Dating WITHOUT APPS in 2022,"TLDR; On your daily travels, try talking to girls, it’s a bit daunting but sets yourself apart from of other guys, just don’t be a creep when doing it.

**WHERE TO GO TO MEET GIRLS**

To find a girl you want talk to, can be almost anywhere ex: (bookstore, grocery store, thrifting stores, restaurants, or on your walk to work). I would avoid doing this at gyms, outdoors at night, or when a girl has her earbuds in. Catching someone off guard is the worst thing you can do to land yourself in creepville. But you can use your own common sense.

**APPROACHING GIRLS**

NEVER ever approach from behind unless she dropped something. It best if you guys are next to each other in an isle at the store, or in a book store, but when outside, the rules are more liberal. In short, feel it out, and if you think you’re being creepy, you probably are, so find something that works for you.

**HOW TO TALK TO THEM**

Once you’ve approached them, that is half the battle, make sure to maintain a smile, and good eye contact, but not TOO much or they’ll think something is wrong lol.

Make sure to say something that maintains context to something that focuses on the environment, make a clever/quick statement about (what school do they go to, their shoes, what they have in their cart, the weather, if they like that book, really anything. 

Think of approaching a girl like going through a broken traffic light. You don’t really know what to do, but just proceed with caution and try to get through as smoothly as possible.

Make sure you receive some sort of consent before approaching and talking, try smiling with eye contact and if she’s smiles back, you’re golden. But things rarely go this good lol.

**GETTING THE NUMBER**

Well you’ve made it this far, you are 3/4ths of the way there and it’s time to end the convo and return to your daily lives, but of course not without getting her # first. 

If she was receptive to your conversation, laughing at your jokes, and smiling, and not visibly uncomfortable, congratulations you’ve made it! Politely ask “is it okay if I get your number”, or do what I do and just give a business card and ask her to add you on Instagram. If she doesn’t add you, well at least you know. If she does, proceed to text her a bit afterwards, don’t do that “wait 3 days shit” that’s horrible advice.

Thanks, and good luck out there dudes. Let’s make 2022 a year of good dates and good memories.

845,He dumped me but wants to come by to end things in person,"\+++++ Update below +++++

I met this guy online and we hit it off incredibly well. Long story short we meet for the first time in person, he stays the whole weekend even asking me to be his girlfriend because he has strong feelings for me. We wanted to have sex but he couldn't get it up, after that he become more and more quiet.

He left sunday and tells me the next day that he doesn't know why but his feelings were gone when he got home and he thinks it makes no sense to continue our relationship now. I say feelings have to grow and we need to develop them in real life and over time, you dont need to be head over heals after the first meeting, and to not throw our connection away. He agreed to meet up again and talk. But after that talk on the phone I could just tell that he was done emotionally. So I text him a few days of no contact later that I think he is right and we shouldn't continue like this and that my initial feelings are now gone as well, because of how he acted after we met. And that we don't have to meet up again.

He says he agrees but still wants to tell me in person what an amazing person I am and say thank you for the nice time we had and if he can come by my place to do so.

I was really surprised about that because I thought he would be relieved he didn't have to meet up again.

What do you guys think of that, why would he want to come by? Is it just to be a decent guy and end it in person? I don't know if I should agree and if I even want to see him again. Thank you for your opinion!

UPDATE:Thank you all for the comments, didnt expect to get so much advice! Since many asked for an update:

847,If a guy calls his exes toxic…like all of them…then that probably means he’s the toxic one right?,"I (19F) have been talking to this guy (20M) for a while and let’s say he’s made a reputation for himself. The people in his area know him for being rude/weird/player but these people are just acquiantances and I don’t know them that well either so who knows if they’re being honest right? Maybe its just rumors but I mean if a bunch of people are saying that about him then it’s probably true? 

Knowing him for a while, he’s usually a pretty honest person like the blunt kind so I would expect he wouldn’t lie. The exes all seem to have had done things that were definitely toxic but based on the behavior I’ve seen from him, he could definitely be the toxic one as well. In some past situations, I felt like he was being manipulative and definitely hiding things but in hindsight, we both acknowledged our wrongdoings and moved on.

Anyways, when a guy calls all his exes toxic, how do you discern that he’s the toxic one…or should you?

849,My first dates seem platonic. Is it weird to ask a date to sit next to me?,"I’ve been on 5 first dates lately and all but 1 felt really platonic. Normally for the first date I do drinks  by the  harbor where we sit across from each other talking for an hour or three, then leave give each other a hug and call it a night.. 

However, after the first five dates I’m starting  to think my dates are coming off as way too platonic. I don’t  go for the kiss on first dates cause after spending hour(s) sitting across from each other not touching it feels weird to go for a kiss.. But  I want to do something to  build chemistry or at least test it.. 

My first thought is just to ask them to sit beside me.. Does it seem weird to ask? For two people to sit next to each other in a booth on a first date?

850,The guy I’ve been dating says he’s not sure if he’s ready to take it to the relationship step due to my age,"Hi guys so I’m needing some advice, I (21F) have been exclusively dating this guy (28M) for about 3 and a half months now. We basically spend every day together, he constantly stays over and we’ve planned a holiday away. The problem is the other night I asked where this was headed in regards to being in an offical relationship and told him I’m happy with where we are now but I’d like to know that this is heading to the next step as I’ve been burnt badly by guys who can’t commit before. He said that he’s not ready to put a label on what we are as the next relationship he gets into he wants it to be his final one as he’s nearly 30. He also says he’s not sure if he wants to rule out kids completely (as I’ve told him that I don’t want to have kids). It made me feel extremely upset as I want to be in a relationship with this guy and to hear him say he’s not sure really hurt my feelings. I told him I wouldn’t wait forever for him to make up his mind and he said that it doesn’t change how he feels about me as he really likes me and isn’t interested in anyone else but he just can’t say that an official relationship with me is what he wants yet. 

Am I wasting my time waiting for him or is this just something that all adults have to think about and I just haven’t hit the age where I can relate to what he’s thinking…

*** new update ***
Hello everyone ! I appreciate everyone’s honest feedback on the situation and want to say thank you so much for all the advice. 

To clear a few things up, although I am only 21 I wouldn’t exactly clarify myself as immature for wanting to know where I stand with someone. I live by myself, i work full time for my dream job and already know what I want for myself in the future. I unfortunately just don’t like not knowing where I fit in with someone hence putting the question to him. 

I also spoke to said male since this post and have managed to gain a better view into what he meant. Although he stated he is not sure where HE stands in the kid department (as he’s not even sure he wants them either) he said he still wants to build on our relationship and can see us heading in that direction as he wants a relationship with me just believes in taking things slow. We had a very long discussion and he said that his decision about getting into a relationship has nothing to do with my personality or our compatibility in anything else other than kids. He has made it very clear that the decision on whether we get into a relationship is actually up to ME as I’m the one who would be settling down at a younger age which I have told him if I am happy and it happens then I’m not going to let my age stop me just because I haven’t “experienced life” as much as everyone has told me.",u2mfxo,353,210,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/u2mfxo/the_guy_ive_been_dating_says_hes_not_sure_if_hes/

Surely every once in a while I will see attractive women that are worth asking out, but I just don't have the desire to ask them out. Im not afraid to ask women out, Im just so exhausted by trying to strategize dating and treat it as a job because honestly I got bored of this job. Do you think that this a normal mindset ?

When we got there, I was at the cashier second and just paid for the two of us. There was a bit of a line behind us and it just seemed more efficient. He said thanks and we had a good date. 

When I told my friends about it, they were “disappointed and mad” - their words.

First date should be him. I am for equality and am a feminist, are some etiquettes that should be met.”

859,I've been on 5 dates with this girl; I am overthinking things?,"Title.  I've been on 5 great dates with a girl I met on Bumble.  We have had sex at the end of the last 3 dates.  I am really into her.

About a week ago she told me how she really likes me and would like to see how things go and how she even told her mother about me.  She is busy with her work and always tells me that ""she makes time for someone important like me.""

Recently I can't tell if she is starting to pull away or if I'm just overthinking.  Previously she use to text me a fair bit during the day including selfies, however, now it isn't as often.  I feel like I have to carry a lot of the conversations when we text but she still used pet names (i.e., handsome & babe) when talking to me and is always down to meet up.  Nothing felt off yesterday on our date; we were cuddling after sex I told her that I like spending time with her and she proceeded to kiss me/my neck.  I am tentatively suppose to see her on Saturday.  I was also tentatively going to have the ""What are we?"" conversation after the next 2ish dates or so.

1. Am I overthinking this?  I think the fact that she still wants to see me and be sexually active with me is a great sign.  She has only ever ""cancelled"" one date (our last one) but offered another day right away (i.e.,""I'm sorry anon something came up, can we do Wednesday instead?"").
2. Should I ask her if everything is okay?  I feel like that might come off as too strong and scare her away.

I am at a point rn where i wanna start dating for fun I never really dated a lot and my last and only bf was in high school when I was 16 we never really did anything outside of making out and some oral here and there. 
The thing is now that i finally wanna date and actually be sexual every guy I meet just turns into this weirdo and starts trying either fetishize (i hope that's the correct word) my virginity or talk shit about other women and that's just a huge turn off for me.

I don't try to make the fact that I'm a virginity a secret when meeting a new guy but out of the 11 men i spoke with or went out with in the last couple of months 2 of them said they're not into inexperienced women and the other were just gross and had this weird misconception about virginity and purity (it was just weird lol....but let me not say all of them cause one of them didn't really care we just didn't click)

So there is this friend[26m] of mine, he's a very chill guy and i trust him a lot. So he knows about my awful dating life and I talked to him about me just wanting to have sex just to get it over with. He pretty much told me to be patient and the right guy will come but I'm not looking for mr right I just wanna have fun and explore myself sexually. He told me if I'm 100% sure this is what i want then yeah he'll be honored to ""pop my cherry"" but he's giving me an entire week to reeaally think about it.

I’m clearly younger and would feel weird about being too aggressive about making an effort to see each other or talk outside of work since I’m newer and younger. And, to be honest, I don’t have a ton of dating experience. 

Before people say, “don’t date a coworker,” we don’t work closely together and get along reallllly well. I’ve always had a crush on him virtually but meeting in person had my head spinning, and I think his, too. The vibes are just ~there~ (also used the rule for “is he into you or just his personality” and there is def some special attention so I don’t think I’m acting totally out of line) 

I know it’s risky for men to do too much because of HR/SH claims, but I want him to know he ~can~ if he wanted to. It feels like I’m picking up what he’s putting down but I want to be clear he can push that boundary further without him feeling like he’s compromising business.

864,I'm 63. You're grandfather's or father's age. I'm thinking about dating a 28 year old woman who asked me out.,"I've been married for 32 years. We have adult children between 26 and 30. My wife, who is an absolute beauty at 56, and I decided to separate a few months ago. We still talk daily and I consider her and she me, best friends. We own a ranch, where I'm living and a nice home down in the valley where she lives. She's been on a few dates, I've really not cared to go out until recently. There in lies the rub.

I frequent a bar a couple days a week after work. There's a very young to me(28f), very attractive bartender, who has always fawned over me over the past couple years. ""There's my silver fox.."" ""Oh my...good to look at you again, handsome..."", ""Hey stud.."" Bartender talk, I get it. I tip well, flattered , but never thought a thing about it. We've chatted about everything from humor, to food, to parents/siblings, to boyfriend advice, to life, to sex talk. All from my vantage point, innocent chat.

Tonight she asked me to take her out. She wants to go up to the ranch, sit by the fire and drink with me, have me cook for her. I'm also a chef in an earlier life, btw. She told me she feels safe around me like she's in a warm glove when we talk. She told me she'd dress how she knows I'd like when she came up to our hill. I was pretty stunned. She's basically my daughter's age. She knows our daughter and both of our sons. 

At 63, I'm still pretty well put together from my build, to my personality, my station in life, kind of rugged but a class act; etc. Easy on the eyes, I've been told. She told me I was like a character from Yellowstone. Whatever...

Here's the problem. Is this her fantasy, daddy issues, sugar daddy thing? She's in nursing school and lives well on her own, comes from money.  I can create a gigantic problem with my children if I was suddenly dating someone their age who they know.  I feel totally comfortable with her and really like her as a person. I consider her my friend after the years.  She's crazy sexy. We'd have a blast short term. Yet, she has no future with me as far as long term. Jesus H, I'm 35 years her senior. The age difference is just stupid. 

I'd love to be back together with my wife and that's not out of the question. We just had a wonderful Thanksgiving with our family yesterday. 

Do I just take an old man lark and have fun with a cool, sexy young woman and be honest about the future. (I think she knows that too) Take one last shot? Or, let it go? She was so excited and embarrassed tonight to tell me she wanted to go out with me. Said she's been thinking about how to ask me out since she heard I was separated.

868,How do you manage dating multiple people and sexual expectations?,"Okay so I’ve learned almost everyone dates multiple people at a time. I’m still having a hard time understanding this. 

- How do you know who you like vs someone you just feel lust for? 

- How do you handle competing for someone’s attention?

- Are you waiting until you’re exclusive to have sex? If you’re not, are you having sex with everyone you date? 

- If the person you like the most doesn’t want to have sex until they’re exclusive with you, but you don’t want to be exclusive b/c you’re not sure, do you continue to see that person and have sex with someone else? 

I’m talking to someone and I’ve discovered he has multiple women he is entertaining. I told him that’s fine but sex is off the table. I want to be exclusive before I have sex. My reason: a man won’t like me but of course he’ll sleep with me until he gets the woman he really wants. 

He said he’s a sexual person and now he believes I have a hang up on sex. I don’t think I do. But I don’t think anyone should have full access to me and my body when they aren’t even sure about being with me.

So then we looked 4 seconds to eachother and I said, ""I want to try something else"".She replied ""I sense it"", then looked away sideways, ""but I don't feel ready yet"".

During dinner she did mention she's critical about having a relationship. A man should be an added value to her life, otherwise she's perfectly happy to stay independent.

I'm really confused right now. What should I make of this...?

871,Practical dating advice that has nothing to do with dating,"1. Learn to cook - everybody wants a partner who can cook them at least one nice home-cooked meal, and you want a partner that can cook you at least one nice meal. Eating out isn’t always a best option, and when you feel under the weather you want somebody who can at least make you a nice bowl of soup. 

2. Take care of your health - physical, mental and financial. Work on getting rid of debt. Set financial goals. If you want to get married one day, know that you should be saving up for a wedding. If you don’t love your body, work on it. Workout. Go for walks. Go for runs. If your mental health is struggling, work on it - work on relationships that you might need to repair. Work on building new friendships or strengthening existing ones. Try cutting out social media if you think that’d help. 

3. Work on becoming a better person. Be a kinder person - less gossiping, less negativity, cutting out unnecessary drama. 

4. Learn something new or do something new - learn a new language, pick up a book, watch a movie. Get into a new sport. Have some sort of a passion you love to talk about. Have something that makes you love life. Care about something. 

5. Especially if you are planning to have kids one day: Get your drivers license. Even if you don’t plan on having kids and getting a car is not in the cards right now, being able to drive is pretty important. If you plan on living in city apartments forever that’s not a problem, but most people want to move out to suburbs and raise kids there. Suburbs, especially in North America is impossible to get around without a car. 

If you want someone who loves adventure, get your passport if you don’t have one. That’s a minimum requirement. If you wanna go above and beyond: make sure your job has benefits coverage (dental, drugs, pension, etc). Pretty nice to have in terms of family planning. 

I know a lot of people have grim attitudes about being able to afford a house, saving and being able to afford to marry and not everyone wants that. So know what you want with your life and what you want your life to look like. Do you want to live in a house? Do you want to have kids one day? Do you want to live in a city or are you willing to move to the suburbs? 

Take care of yourself. All that means is this:

Feed yourself well, sleep well, take care of your health and your brain. Be intentional with your direction and life and know that you are awesome. 

Good luck!",sfylh2,333,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sfylh2/practical_dating_advice_that_has_nothing_to_do/

GTA 5 online

Okay so I need advice. 

My fiancé is a gamer, has been since the day he moved in. He plays your normal siege, escape from tarcov?, call of duty. But recently he started getting really into GTA 5 online with some friends, and even has a family (2 brothers and 2 sisters) and a mechanic shop. Okay cool whatever. 

But literally this man spends fucking hours playing this game chatting away. EVERY time I go in there he’s talking and playing with this one girl. Am I out of line for being upset that he is literally spending hours talking to and hanging out with her. Then he rarely wants to go do things with me aside from going to Walmart or when he wants to ride his bike to Harley. 

I’m offended, mad, maybe a bit jealous. I literally just sat there to see if it was her, and it was so I told him it’s odd that he spends hours just chatting away with this broad and all he said was no. So I walked away- clearly upset and he’s still in there playing and talking to her. I spent all day cleaning our house, doing laundry, made and cleaned up dinner. He took his plate in the office to eat and play.

Give me some advice people. Tell me I’m either crazy and to get over myself, or I’m not crazy and this is odd behavior. I’m about to tell him to sleep on the couch.",w4yh7s,335,214,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/w4yh7s/relationship_advice/

876,"Word of advice, learn about attachment styles. You'll notice them in yourself and others.","Attachment styles are the ways we act in relationships, more commonly shown when we have conflict within them. There are four main types that dictate your patterns. These were the result of your childhood and how your main provider acted towards you.   


The four are:

* Secure
* Anxious
* Disorganized
* Avoidant

&#x200B;

Most of us are one of the bottom three. Anxious is prone to overworry and overcrowd the other person in an attempt at forced intimacy and closeness. They fear conflict or anything they say will effect and lead the other person to leave them.   


Avoidant attachment styles may show symptoms of depression and anxiety. Children of avoidant parents or caretakers may not outwardly express need for affection or care. They tend to avoid strong displays of closeness and intimacy. As soon as things get serious, dismissive/avoidant individuals are likely to close themselves off.  


Disorganized attachment style lacks a coherent approach towards relationships. On the one hand, they want to belong. They want to love and be loved. While on the other hand, they are afraid to let anyone in. They have a strong fear that the people who are closest to them will hurt them. They are very back and forth.  


Secure is very simple! It's secure, open and willing to engage without being needy and over compensating. They talk about their needs and care about yours.

Is that true? If so, how are ""unattractive"" people supposed to find love? Or people like myself who are 33 and no longer ""youthful"" looking, but still want children?

Hearing this over and over is really weighing on my confidence. Is beauty really that important? Because most people aren't 10's...yet social media makes it seem like only 10's will find a partner.

879,"I hate the fact that if you're off your game for even one second, its enough to completely kill a girl's attraction to you","Just something I've noticed. For the last couple girls I've been talking to, all signs pointed to everything going well. But then I have one moment where I'm not really locked in and butter smooth and it seems like she doesn't have any interest any more.

For example, theres a lady at work (we don't really work together; just kind of in close proximity occasionally) that everything was turning out really good with. I gave her my number, she hit me up, we chatted about some stuff we wanted to go do, which got shut down due to Covid, and I said I would figure something out.

The next day, I happen to bump into her when I wasn't really expecting it. I guess I was a little nervous or off my game or something, but I just didn't feel all that smooth. We kind of had a brief little awkward chat, and went our separate ways for work.

I texted her about 2 days later (hadn't seen her since our awkward encounter) with new plans, and got left on read.

I've had something similar happen where all signs point to a woman being into me and excited to go out, but one moment of anxiousness, or introversion, or whatever you call it, its enough to completely kill what you have going for you.

Anyone experience something similar to this? How is this even possible to stay on your game all the time. I refuse to believe that there are dudes around there who are always 100% confident and never falter around attractive women. Maybe a few; but I think those dudes have to be clinical narcissists or sociopaths, or just lying to themselves to make themselves feel better.

880,Every guy I date never wants anything serious with me after.,"I’m so sick of this pattern happening, I’ll find a guy, sometimes immediately they will say they want nothing serious and just want sex which I decline, then end up with a girl friend weeks later. Or I meet a guy, openly communicate what we want early on, do couple stuff, meet friends, family, go on dates etc and then 2 - 3 months down the road they change their minds completely without any explanation or warning. The last guy even told me he wanted to be exclusive then 3 days later does a complete 180 and stops speaking to me. I was with someone for 1.5 years who always said he didn’t want anything serious, kept on seeing him then we were in a relationship but then changed his mind too after one tiny disagreement which he even admits was trivial. I’m at a loss as to what I’m doing wrong here. There’s no correlation to whether I have sex on the first date or after a few dates the outcome is always the same. 

I’m a nice girl, kind, funny, in shape (I go to the gym 2-3 times a week and get positive comments alot by guys) good looking, eats healthy, lots of friends, hobbies and have a busy life with work, friends etc everyone I talk to says I deserve the world and one day I will but I’m starting to think my one day will never come. Every guy has acted like they wanted to be with me and when I spoke about it, agree they want the same thing too and soon after end up saying they actually don’t and then what’s worse get mad at me for questioning their behaviour making me feel crazy. Now my judgement is all off. I feel like no matter what guys will never want to be with me really.

Edit -  I’m 31

Edit 2 - can I say I am not short of options by any means, the dudes I have chosen from my options are the ones who end up acting this way. I’m not choosing to date guys who haven’t already shown very much interest from the start.

He used to text me everyday and sent memes. He even told me that he wanted us to be exclusive and I really liked him so I agreed to just seeing him for the time being. We had some really great time and I wanted to be serious with him. 

Things were going well for awhile until New Year. He started being cold and uninterested. It seemed like I am the only one who is trying to make a connection and reached out to him. He always busy (we barely even talked anymore unless I initiate the conversation) and came up with a lot of excuses (back when we started hanging out those did not seem like an issue at all and now they become huge issue). He kept postponing and say lets hangout tomorrow but the next day he will come up with a new reason to postpone it

The tipping point for me was yesterday when I expressed to him how I felt. He told me we can talk later today and he will stop by. Not even a word from him after, he just straight up bailed without a text. He was still online the whole time but he could not send me a text to say he is not coming? Is it a subtle way to tell me to back off? He used to be very nice and caring and sweet. But to this point I just feel hurted and sad. I still like him a lot but I am not sure if I should keep pursuing. F(24) and M(28)

Update: I sent him a text just to say goodbye thank you (also let him know that all the guys I turned down for him said thanks 🤣). He ignored my text but I am happy at least I gave myself some closure. And showed him that even if he is mean to me Im still a better person than him.
Thanks for all the advice guys. It gave me a lot of strength and hope! Got me through a very long day! Love you all

Update 2: He texted me back and gave me some other reasons that he was out late and had to leave early for work in the morning. Also said sorry to be a bailing bitch. Im a great person and hope all the best for me. I guess that should be the end for the story !

889,"We are not typically attracted to what is best for us, but rather what is familiar to us","We all likely know someone who makes questionable, even dangerous, choices in romantic partners, they always seem to choose people who are just not right for them and who treat them poorly, and we wonder why they keep doing it and why they do not change their ways. This might even be you. Those choices are obviously negatively impacting their life and everyone knows it. 

So why do they do? Why do people choose people that are so obviously bad for them? Because we are not typically attracted to what is best for us, but what is familiar to us. This familiarity typically comes from how we were treated by our caregivers when we were children. 

Some people's caregivers treated them with love, care and compassion, and taught them that they are loved and worthy, and not to accept being treated poorly. Hence they tend to go on to choose partners who reflect that. Unfortunately, some people's caregivers treated them as if they are worthless, useless, good for nothing scum who deserve to be treated like shit, possibly physically and sexually abused. Therefore, they may grow up to learn that that is what they deserve and they are not worthy of anything more. Some people had to take care of their caregiver, possibly because they were alcoholic or drug addicted, making attempts to try and ""fix"" them. Again, they may seek out partners who need caring for and ""fixing"". 

This familiarity, although it can be hugely distressing, is either consciously, more likely subconsciously, attractive. Once you know this, you can begin to make an effort to change this. You can learn that your attraction to someone is not an indication that they are what's best for you, and if you've had a questionable upbringing, may be you should question these feelings and make a conscious effort to work and teaching yourself that you deserve to be treated well. Therapy can help. Being around people who value and love you will help. Doing thing things that raise your self-esteem and self-respect will help. Forming healthy attachments to people who are good for you can help to rewire the circuits that cause you to choice people who are bad for you. The brain has the ability to adapt and change, you are not stuck like this forever, but you must give your brain the stimulus to change, and that takes work.",v37ixo,318,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v37ixo/we_are_not_typically_attracted_to_what_is_best/

892,Having passions and hobbies is crucial for self-esteem. Don’t put the opposite sex at the center of your universe,"In our busy modern lives, we can get caught in a cycle of merely existing. We work, run errands, maybe get some exercise in here and there. We put our own development, interests, and passions on the back burner.

It has to stop. Your personal interests, your pursuit of your passion should be your priority. This doesn’t mean necessarily that your passion has to be your job. However, often times your hobbies and passions will create unexpected opportunities for entrepreneurship, even if it isn’t your primary source of income.

Personally, my passion is writing. While it currently isn’t my primary job, I’m pursuing my writing primarily because I enjoy it, but utilizing it to supplement my income, and hopefully transition in a full time career.

You should never pursue a passion to attract the opposite sex, but nonetheless, one of the most attractive general traits is a someone with passion for something that isn’t just their relationship . When men and women alike put a romantic interest at the center of their universe, neediness ensues. This doesn’t mean you should emotionally neglect your partner if you’re in a relationship, but reversely, neglecting your own self-development for the sake of a relationship will turn you into an unbalanced, unattractive person.

Many people say that they don’t know what their passion is. This is normal, but often times they know, but they just don’t want to reveal to themselves or others what they truly want. This is a deeply personal component of who we are, and it makes us vulnerable to pursue and put out into the universe what we want.

The worst thing you can do is let the opinion of others deter you. You will always have people who will dissuade you, mock you, and not believe in you. It’s because they themselves are scared. It’s something you have to accept and press on.",r82ohu,322,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/r82ohu/having_passions_and_hobbies_is_crucial_for/

I basically just told him i have it and that he is free to tell me if we continue dating or not. I dont want to tell him while he is already on top of me… texting also gives the other person space and time to react. 

Been feeling bad the whole day :( i really like him and he has been really sweet. Having herpes is a bitch

Did i do the right thing?

Edit to add: we were texting since january. We only met last feb 22. We had 2 lovely dates. He really enjoyed my company. On the first date we spent 6 hours together. He said he was surprised that he wanted to stay so long and converse. Second date he cooked for me at his home. He got racy and was kissing me all over. I told him i needed to go home because of an early trip. He was really holding on to me as long as he could… then i told him my situation through text a day after that second date. Because i felt he was going to expect to have intercourse soon… so we didnt have intercourse yet

Final edit: I am very thankful to all of those who have empathized with me and have told me their experiences with dating with herpes and disclosing. Because it is a preventable std, being educated matters a lot. A lot of stigma surrounding it. Having herpes actually doesnt hamper us from doing anything in life and the outbreaks get lesser and lesser over time. It can also be much lesser taking the vacyclovir. Plenty of research is also being done to have a vaccine against it. (HPV vaccine for genital warts is already available. So i am positive HSV vaccine will be here soon).

Having had HSV 2 since 2017, I’ve only had one or two outbreaks after the first year. I do everything normally and dont have problems in life. Although i was just depressed at first because the person who gave it to me did not disclose, I eventually accepted that it is much like having other diseases/illnesses. I can still live my life.

I accepted a labelless relationship because I am deeply in love with a man who told me labels ruin everything. He told me that I deserved better, and he didn't have time between school and work for a committed relationship. My rose-colored glasses were superglued to my face, and I convinced myself that he would come around and that he was worth waiting for. I knew deep down he loved me the way I did him, and that he'd figure it out eventually (lol).

We dated for the past year with no labels but in the last 3 months, things really started to heat up for us. I was introduced to his family and friends and spent more time together than we ever did. By the way things were going, I had no doubt in my mind that this was working its way towards a serious, committed relationship. Any sane person would, right? It seemed virtually impossible for him to even think about/look at/entertain another woman.

This week, he went back to his home state for the holidays.

Last night, I found out he spent the entire week sleeping with an old high-school fling. He brought her around his family and our friends.

I am devastated. And it's all because I didn't listen to him when he told me he wasn't looking for anything serious and that he wasn't good enough for me.

He's currently blocked on everything, and he will never see me again. He doesn't deserve another second of my time.

The worst part about all of this is that as I sit here, on Christmas day by myself, trying not to have an absolute mental breakdown every 5 minutes, I realize that I still love him. And I probably always will. I will be in pain for a very long time.

1. Group photos. You get 1, 2 max. And it needs to be clear who you are. A picture of you with 14 other bridesmaids makes it hard to tell who you are and even if I can tell, it doesn't help me much. It's totally fine to put a sticker or something over the other people that aren't you. 
2. Filters. Don't use them. I have seen profiles where all pictures are the same mega-filter and had no idea what the person actually looked like. Please don't use any.
3. Case of same face. Have different action shots. Five picture of your face close up with different backgrounds doesn't tell me a whole lot. 
4. Message me on snap/insta. I'm here for a reason. Forcing me somewhere else makes me think you have alterior motives. You can include your Instagram/Snap I suppose, but it should be minor.
5. No bio. It's there for a reason. Tell me about yourself. A blank bio and only pictures sends a message. 
6. Be the more attractive one in group pics. Per #1, group pics are fine (as long as it's obvious who you are and you're not 1 of 15), but if the other person or people are noticable more attractive, you might want to choose a different picture.
7. Try not be be demanding. ""I'm not gonna put up with..."" Or ""You have to/can't be..."" Shut things down. We want to open up.
8. Super far away pictures. Yes, you at the grand canyon is cool, but you're about 4 pixels tall and I can't see you. I'm here for you, not the Grand Canyon.
9. Selfies. If all or most of your pics are selfies (especially if you're in the car) they all end up looking the same. Variety is good.
10. Bathing suits. Whatever body you have, if you're comfortable, go for it. But only bathing suit pics sends a ""body first"" message (no judgement). Also...
11. Full body ""I'm not hiding anything"" pics are important. Many times through clever angles and certain photos, it's hard to tell if you're big, small, thin, thicc, built, or whatever. I often assume if I can't tell, you're hiding something. 
12. Prompts/bio: tell me what makes you different. Everyone ""loves to travel"". Where are you going next or what was the best/worst experience you had and why? I'm so tired of people just saying they love to travel.
13. This may be controversial, but drinking or the Office is not a personality. Tell me more. 
14. If you have pics with kids, it should be somewhere if they are your kids or not. Calling out ""not my kid"" is fine or that your an aunt is fine. Just so it's clear.
15. Giant sunglasses. I totally get it's a style, but a picture of you in poor light, with a hat and giant sunglasses doesn't do anyone any good. It could be anyone under there.
16. Mirror selfies. Generally just not great, but they can be if you're dressed up or trying to tell a story with it. If you don't have a ton of photos of yourself then I suppose because it is generally very clear what you look like (which is good), but doesn't open anything to conversation if it's just you in normal clothes with a toilet behind you. 
17. Short prompt answers or ""just ask"". Those close conversations generally. A short answer can work if it leads to a conversation, but generally more words can lead to a story or question.
18. Don't put all the burden on me. Putting something like ""I'll love you if you can make me laugh"" (that could be it's own item honestly) or ""buy me food"" or ""buy me a drink"" puts out expectations that I can only meet. Now there's pressure and I have to do all the ""doing"" and you just get to sit back and soak up the good stuff. 
19. Use as many pics as you can. Don't only have 1 or 2.
20. If I had a nickel for every time I saw these or a variation of them, I'd be rich: ""Reservations are my love language"", ""You have to make me laugh"", "" I love to travel"", "" Church the brunch then nap"" (I'm in the south), ""My goal is to get off this app"", "" I'm bad at these apps / idk what to say"", "" Follow me on XYZ, I'm never on here"", over-filtered photos, duckface, all or mostly group photos.

This isn't meant to criticize, but to help and be supportive. You're all valuable. Let me know if you have questions. I'll do my best to answer.

898,It bothers me when he takes hours to reply. Am I crazy?,"It really bugs me when he takes more than 2 hours to get back to me. He seems trustworthy but makes me think that on your day off you’ll be hanging out with someone else and that’s why it takes so long to reply. I get that we all have things to do, I really don’t want to be unreasonable but personally when I take a really long time to reply I’ll apologize or something so that the person I’m talking to doesn’t think anything of it. Am I crazy or unreasonable? Help me understand

Edit: Okay guys, after reading (most) of the responses I realized a few things. 
- It is unreasonable to expect someone to always respond quickly. Even on their days off because like any human being they just want to chill.
- I could bring this up if it’s really an issue, but it’s actually unattractive to expect to be given explanations or whereabouts.
- I have fear of abandonment therefore I sabotage things, to avoid getting hurt.
- Vulnerability is actually a good thing, so if I decide that this is really a big issue I can always communicate it.
- Maybe I want to be in control of things so I expect all of these things
- Everyone has different texting styles
- He also doesn’t give me reasons to mistrust him, I’m just in my head.

AND ironically, I have a life that I have to attend to so I’ll read and respond to your comments later lmao~~~

So much has happened in just 4yrs of my dating life that i’m starting to wonder if there is something wrong with me.

i really have taken as much precautions as i can think of. i don’t go out with guys with a player reputation even if we remain friends or hang out in the same circles, i do in-depth research either through social media or mutual friends, i don’t talk to random guys that hit on me when i’m out unless it’s a friend of a friend. i really don’t know what else i can/should do…

902,No kiss on the first date,"
This Sunday I met up with a guy for a brunch date after a few weeks of talking. Everything seemed to be fine, we left and as he was walking me to my car to say goodbye he leaned in for a kiss which caught me off guard so he landed my cheek. While we were at brunch he mentioned a second date and even called me on the way home. Then he says to me that if I didn’t kiss him on the second date that there wont be a third. I again was caught off guard about this comment, he then said that his friend told him that if a girl doesn’t kiss you on the first date she isn’t interested and to cut her off. I found this comment to be a demand and I didn’t like it at all. He didn’t contact after that. I sent him a text saying what just because I didn’t kiss you you don’t want to talk to me anymore and he said get lost. How you guys/gals feel about this. Was I wrong not to kiss him on a first date for brunch in broad daylight in a parking lot?

906,Wait to have sex until it feels genuine,"Hello! 
I just wanted to say I feel there’s a hidden rush to having sex early in dating stages. I agree sexual compatibility is important, yet it won’t be good if both partners aren’t feeling at ease and genuinely want to do it. 

What I mean is there are moments and dates where sex is like okay, we can do this and feel like it, and there are others that it all went so well sex is like a MUST. My recommendation is wait for that must the first time. Make it intense and passionate and worth the wait, maybe the must comes in the second or third date, who knows. Maybe it’s just my personal experience as a woman, but I need to build a connection before having sex. If the sex comes before, for some reason I get slightly unmotivated or overwhelmed because maybe I wasn’t as ready as I should have been. If, however, the sex comes in the right moment, I get extremely hooked, because I see it’s real and craved intimacy and oh god does it make a difference! I just feel they like me and are enjoying me and the same viceversa. 

Again, this is a personal opinion based on previous good and bad experiences that I bet would have been better had things been taken a little bit more patiently.",t2o7up,315,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/t2o7up/wait_to_have_sex_until_it_feels_genuine/
907,Dating a person is so easy if they actually like you,"I think that this is a fact that it’s overlooked by most, me included in the beginning.

Assuming that you are both emotionally healthy people: **if they like you, then dating will be super easy.**

&#x200B;

>\- No inconsistent communication  
>  
>\- No guessing or games  
>  
>\- Setting up a date will be super smooth  
>  
>\- No need to impress anyone in the date just be yourself  
>  
>\- No pressure to kiss, have sex or whatever  
>  
>\- If anything gets in between you will find a solution together  
>  
>\- The exclusivity talk will come sooner and naturally  
>  
>\- If things don’t work out for some reason you kindly stop seeing each other and possibly stay friends

Now some warnings: if it’s too easy maybe you are a victim of love bombing for manipulation or because the other person is emotionally immature and chases butterflies, a beautiful animal that give a strong impression but doesn’t live long. So be aware of this.

&#x200B;

I think that too many people try to date people they are not interested or not putting the effort, it’s pointless, you end up wasting time.

**No effort = No dating**

Start  to require this and you will waste less time, have less heartbreaks and contribute to an healthier dating.

* Redditor A: Go take dance and yoga classes to meet people

* *Redditor B: Make friends with people first, nobody wants to date strangers*
* Redditor A: Gamer guys show immaturity
* *Redditor B: I met my BF playing WoW and DnD*
* Redditor A: No one will love you if you don't love yourself first
* *Redditor B: I suffered with depression, social anxiety, low self-esteem etc. but met someone on OkCupid*
* Redditor A: Focus on yourself, forget about seeking a partner, it looks desperate
* *Redditor B: If you don't go out, being proactive and asking people out, then you won't find anyone*

I rarely meet a women over 30 that I’m attracted to, and when I do, of course they have kids or aren’t single. Usually both. The ones that are single with no kids aren’t attractive (to me) the vast majority of the time. 

Dating in your late 30s sucks. Maybe when I’m 45, I’ll be old enough where most single women will have adult children, which is fine. Thing is, I really don’t want to wait that long. I’m fucking sick of being single!

I’ve tried dating apps and whatnot, but it’s the same thing as irl, except these women are at least single, but most have a kid/kids. Otherwise they’re poly or something.

Anyway, does anyone know how to meet women, 30+? Or am I just shit out of luck? Or would dating someone who’s like 23 not be that big of a deal?

911,Read this If you want your relationships to last,"If you are dating someone new or have been in a long term relationship you have to understand that the courtship never ends!

The way you were treating the other person in the beginning of your relationship is how you should always treat them. That's how they fell for you in the first place!

Looks can get you through the door but personality is what really makes a relationship last. Nature already took care of the attraction when it comes to the physical part.

As months go by men end up becoming complacent. They stop courting their lover like they did in the beginning.

* They stop communicating effectively
* They don't Date their partner anymore (Set up definite dates, Surprises and Keeping the mystery alive)
* They don't go the extra mile to understand where they are coming from regarding an issue
* Men don't realize that sometimes women just get bored and come and go as they please ( you should let them instead of turning into a stalker or abusive partner)
* Women don't realize that Men sometimes have to go into their little Bat caves to fix a problem their are dealing with. Men usually like to fix things by themselves.(Don't feel hurt when your man seems a bit distant, watch and think. Is he really distant because I have done something to upset or offend him in any way?, if the answer is no, then most cases he is figuring things out in his own way)

&#x200B;

There are people who get it. There really are. But in most cases its the complete opposite.

And of course there are always exceptions! Not everyone is the same but In my experience what I understood from my relationships and from people who have very healthy ones it all comes down to these things.

Communication ( Go the extra mile to figure out what your partner is not telling you. When they say nothing is wrong, Dig deeper! Humor is your biggest ally)

There has to be space between you two. I don't mean physical space(which in some cases is good),

I mean there must be space so you don't get complacent. Go do your activities, go Hang out with your friends!, Have some hobbies, Hit the gym and try to become the best version of yourself!

In the end its all about being the person you were in the beginning. In most cases you were happy. Fulfilled and had things to do outside your relationship.

&#x200B;

This is not a post where one person has to offer more than the other! It takes both parties to commit as efficiently for a relationship to work.

&#x200B;

You can believe you are the most attractive, most intelligent, most caring and most special person in the world but some people will not see your value.

And in the opposite perspective you can believe you are the most unattractive, most unintelligent person but it wont matter for the right person!

922,"If you are Christian, you absolutely SHOULD use church as a place to meet singles.","Disclaimer: It’s not popular to be a religious person on Reddit (especially for Christians), but there are some who need to hear this, so it’s worth risking being controversial. 

Disclaimer #2: I think this could apply to other religious communities, but I won’t presume to know what other communities are like. That’s for you to decide. 

I think the advice to just go to church to serve and pursue God (that the church is not a singles gathering place) is incomplete, harmful, and one of the main reasons why Christians are single longer than they should be. 

It should not be easier to ask someone out on a date outside the church for Christians, but because of invisible walls we’ve built with our cultural expectations, Christians hesitate or avoid doing so within the church. 

Fear of someone in the congregation sinning and fear of appearing to sin is keeping us single when we shouldn’t be. The desire for deep intimacy is a good thing and should be guided, celebrated, and championed by the church. 

The result of what most churches are currently practicing and preaching (actively or passively) is either that they are never empowered to go after what God has placed in their hearts or they go and do outside the church what you don’t want them to do inside the church and because of the lack of guidance and disconnection from Christian community, they produce unhealthy and/or outright sinful fruit in their lives. 

To supplement this, God gave us a need for food and water, so to ignore other needs (like a desire for deep intimacy with one person) should be considered ignorant and/or downright arrogant, even if it’s unintentional. 

Loneliness is the result of being ill-equipped or equipped with the wrong tools. Loneliness is not some amorphous ghost that floats around in the ether purely as an idea. There is a scientific connection between loneliness and lower mental, emotional, and physical health. 

If I was an enemy of Christians then I would want to keep Christians distracted and weak, whether that’s from lack of food and water or lack of emotional fulfillment, which is part of how God designed us. 

Stop thinking that singleness is a more holy state of being that protects us from the evils of actually being interested in someone and openly showing it. 

Church absolutely SHOULD be a gathering place for singles. They should gather and ALL should guide and celebrate two who find each other and those who are still actively looking. 

“He who FINDS a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord.” 

-Proverbs 18:22

EDIT: I’d feel remiss if I didn’t present a suggested action plan, so here it is. Search your church first. If there are social barriers keeping you from asking someone at your church out then speak with your pastor or leader about it. If there’s no one at your church that you’re interested in, then stay committed to that church, but visit other churches and other church’s groups/activities.

You could even make a list of these places/groups/events you’d like to visit.

927,I am starting to believe that sexual/physical attraction and emotional attraction are mutually exclusive,"I (24F) have dated my fair share of men. And maybe I’m becoming bitter and need to take a break from the dating scene but I’m starting to believe that physical/sexual attraction and compatibility and emotional attraction and compatibility are mutually EXclusive. 

In my experiences, the men that I have had good physical and sexual compatibility with have been very bad for me emotionally. And when I meet a man that I have emotional attraction to, the physical attraction and sexual compatibility doesn’t really exist. I have tried to go on a decent amount of dates to give time for a physical attraction to occur with someone I emotionally connect to but it never happens. And during physical intimacy, I’m always disappointed and bored. 

I desperately want to make it work with someone that I emotionally connect with but I also don’t want to sacrifice my sex life and attraction. Likewise, I don’t want to sacrifice my emotional well being just because I’m having good sex or finding them get attractive with someone. 

So I’m starting to feel hopeless on finding love that works in those aspects of attraction.  I don’t want to feel like I’m settling on someone but I’m also feeling like that’s what’s ultimately going to happen.

930,Second date when TERRIBLY WRONG. Need kind advice 21F,"First date was amazing and we had so much chemistry and sexual tension. We made out a little at the end of the 4 hour date (we did drinks, arcade etc) 

He invites me for the second date the next day and says he wants to go get sushi. I assumed we were going to dine in so I was dressed up but he wasn’t. He was dressed in comfy clothes and said he was tired from work and wanted to do something more relaxed- he suggested pickup. 

I Should’ve asked more questions because after we picked up the food- the next thing you know were at his apartment . He didn’t even tell me that was the plan. We eat, talk, then we cuddle on the couch watching Netflix. Things got hot and heavy and he started grouping my breasts. I jokingly said no several times but he continued. I straight up told him I didn’t want to do anything sexual until I feel we’re more exclusive and he immediately asked me to be his girlfriend. I feel like he was just saying that so I would put out- so I put my guard up. I was super stiff and you could tell I just wasn’t having it. 

I felt like he was patronizing me and making me seem like I was the crazy one for wanting to wait to do sexual stuff. He said he just wanted to do foreplay stuff and that it was the same as affection- he also said that he’s used to girls putting out by the second date and worried we didn’t have the same sex drive now. 

I told him I actually am a super sexual person but I just wanted to get to know him a little more first. He just kept patronizing me and making me feel like this was all my fault. 

He took me home and didn’t text me when I got back- like he normally does. Im super attracted and really liked this guy and I really want to have sex/do sexual things- I just wanted to wait a couple more dates. Should I send him a follow up text to assure him that it’s not that im not attracted to him, I just need more time to get intimate like that? I feel like after I put my guard up, I wasn’t communicating my feelings directly/ correctly.

931,Guy asks if he needs to clean his room for our first date,"I matched with a guy (30M) on Bumble and made plans to meet (30F). He asked to do a video call and while talking he eventually asks if I could just come over to his place, but I said I prefer meeting outside for a first date. I was surprised when he jokingly asked if he needs to clean his place on the night of the date... He then laughs and says it was a joke and he already feels that I'm not coming home with him. 

I affirmed that I will not sleep with him. He then reluctantly says that we can still meet and have dinner. I also reluctantly agree.

After ending the call, I felt this strong urge to just cancel. I was 5 minutes away from doing it, but I remembered this lovely Reddit community. 

I'm not a person who is against having sex on a first date, having done it a few times. What I can't do is to seal the deal before actually meeting, like I'm doing some sort of transaction. I want to feel a strong attraction and at least a good level of comfort around the person before I consider having sex.

For anyone who read this - would you rather cancel or give it a shot? I think I'm gonna cancel but I'm interested to hear any thoughts!

Edit: I already sent him a text to cancel. As one Redditor commented, I should've mentioned this earlier: he isn't my type (physically) and I was willing to give it a shot hoping he had a good personality or we would get along. After that video call I just knew the vibes were off and I could no longer find any redeeming qualities that would make me interested in him.

932,Why don’t people approach me ?,"I’ve been told countless of times by complete strangers and people whom i’m close with, that i’m beautiful with a great personality. Yet for some reason men nor women approach me romantically, at all. I’m not really sure why ? Yesterday I went to a party with a friend and I consider both of us to be pretty, but for some reason she was approached by so many more men than me. I wasn’t approached by any men. I don’t say this to sound jealous or like i’m comparing myself to my friends, but i just don’t understand why ? 
(not to sound like a dick but i seen not “conventionally attractive “girls get attention from guys at that party) 
I’m not necessarily super out going, but i’m not shy either. Sometimes I question whether or not i’m actually attractive. Like I said i’ve been told by many people that I am, i even get compared to really attractive celebrities all the time-some being Kylie Jenner,Selena Gomez and etc. I’ve even been told that i’m attractive enough to model or act. So I don’t understand ? One time this guy told me that he waited to long to talk to me, because he felt like I was too pretty for him. I don’t think that’s constantly the case though.

935,The first date doesn’t have to be THAT intense I mean damn.,"I am confused as to why so many people want these overly exciting/lavish/extravagant/crazy first dates after meeting on a dating app. I’m a heterosexual male in my 20s, and dating costs money. I generally pay for almost every date that I go on (unless it ends up being like a walk in the park), so it adds up.

Lately, I’ve gotten odd responses when i ask people out to drinks. “Just drinks?” “Don’t you wanna do something more exciting?”, “Lol that’s kinda boring”, “Damn I was hoping you’d suggest Disneyland” (most recent one). Disneyland? We’ve been texting on Hinge for like 2 days lmao 

I personally think if you match with someone on a dating app (and are looking for something longer term), going to drinks is the best first date. The whole purpose of this first date is for each of us to decide if we want to see each other again. To do that, I need to see if Im physically attracted to her and if we have chemistry in conversation. It’s HARD to do that at like…an amusement park, concert, or some other setting where you two can’t have undivided attention on each other. I feel like those things can be done on 2nd+ dates after you two have established you have chemistry and are actually interested in each other. I mean shit. 

Also, it’s just easier to suggest more expensive stuff if you aren’t expecting to pay for it, regardless of your gender. Also also, imagine spending all that money on a Disneyland ticket and not liking the person in like 5 mins lol.

TL;DR: Someone is not “cheap, boring, or lame” if they suggest drinks (or something chill) for a first date. They probably just want to get to know you before they go all out.",s77k89,293,150,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/s77k89/the_first_date_doesnt_have_to_be_that_intense_i/

942,"Men’s advice. Subtle touch, flirting, teasing (not negging), and eye contact are key to being viewed as a romantic interest, not a platonic friend","Sometimes a date will go really well—the conversation flows, you both laugh, you have fun—however, the next day you get the “You’re a great guy, but..” text. This can be utterly confusing. I’ve been there.

Having fun and making her laugh is not enough. Making her laugh is only one component of attraction. Some guys make the mistake of believing being funny is the primary component. 

She not only wants have fun, but feel an emotional spark. This can’t be done alone by making her laugh, or going to interesting places. There are several components to laying the foundation of engaging her emotions.

- Subtle, playful, incremental touch. A light hug when meeting her, playfully touching her arm while laughing. This component is crucial. However, it has to make sense in the context of your interaction, or it will come off as being creepy. Touching her hands within the first several minutes of sitting down is an example. If you’re walking, leading by putting your hand on her back lightly if you’re crossing a road or walking to different area shows leadership and has a protective quality at the same time

- Teasing and flirting. There is a  difference between teasing and negging. A neg usually involves a backhanded compliment about her appearance that is meant to make her self conscious. It’s subtle mental manipulation and is unethical. When you tease, you’re both in on the joke. Think of the way you tease someone when you’re in a relationship. When you like someone, it’s a natural behavior to lightly make fun of each other and have fun. Use that same type of energy. If she makes a joke that doesn’t stick, or says something dorky, look away jokingly as if you’re frightened, or for split second act like you’re getting out of your seat to leave. Teasing and flirting go hand in hand. You want to convey subtle sexual energy, though the way you look at her while you’re laughing and teasing. Use restraint; you don’t want to constantly be teasing one another. Ask her open ended questions as well.

- Eye contact. In studies, participants (who were strangers) that were placed in a room and stared into each other’s eyes reported feeling increased feelings of affection after prolonged eye contact. The importance of eye contact can’t be overstated. You don’t want to glare, but you should be maintaining steady eye contact throughout 90% of your conversation, looking away periodically so things don’t appear unnatural. While she’s talking look at her eyes, and then briefly look at her lips, and then back to her eyes. This conveys desire, while helping break the eye contact so it doesn’t turn into staring",s8lb0x,287,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/s8lb0x/mens_advice_subtle_touch_flirting_teasing_not/

https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ux3xx8/girlfriend_jokes_about_having_sex_with_other_guys/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

A few people asked for an update so here it is. Most people said I should just break up with her but I wanted to at least hear her out first. I confronted her about it calmly and told her that the way her and her friend were talking was disrespectful. I told her that she could either sort it out with her friend on her own or I would do it myself. She did say that she wouldn't do it again but I asked why she would make jokes like that while in a monogamous relationship and she just said that she doesn't know. She said that she isn't interested in anyone other than me and that she doesn't even like this guy as a friend but I didn't believe her. The last thing I asked is what she wants from our relationship and then she said ""I'm sorry but I don't want to talk about this right now."".  I felt like she wasn't giving me any input on the situation. It was clear to me that she had something on her mind but she wouldn't tell me. At this point it's on her, I won't talk to her again unless she reaches out and even then I'm going to cut contact if I don't like her response

Thanks everyone for all of the advice

It doesn't really bother me for her to make jokes like this but it does make me feel like I need to be cautious with her. Should I put my foot down on this?

944,I confessed my feelings to my crush and I’d 100% recommend it,"This is the confidence booster I didn’t know existed and as a woman (26,f) it was 100x more scary for me, I have never been so direct with a guy. In the past my version of making the first move was walking past a guy and letting him see me and then choose to approach me lol that was the best you’d get out of me

So he’s been my crush for over 4 months now, it got to a point where we weren’t even in regular communication anymore but I was just stalking his socials admiring and thinking about him from a distance. He’s an amazing person to be around and it was eating me up that I was keeping how I felt towards him a secret and it was growing more and more.  I even thought I’d look ridiculous confessing how I feel considering we don’t talk often anymore.

At first when I was typing the message and actually sent it, I literally screamed in nervousness and I thought I’ll never look at my phone again. And then I felt the embarrassment of randomly confessing my feelings to him, and the embarrassment of if he doesn’t feel the same (highly likely) he’s gonna be unmoved and just like what do I do with this message. 
Then it sank to me that he probably doesn’t feel the same but I felt liberated and I realised my confidence is in my hands! Not his. And by saying it I really am defining my own identity, I’m saying that I have self worth that’s unimpacted by whether you like me or not. 
And I’ve just been going about my business now! And it’s helped me feel like it it’s okay to express vulnerability. And if he responds and says no, I feel like I’ll have a stronger friendship out of it and I won’t care about trying to impress him anymore. 
Infact idc anymore and I feel more confident.
If he blanks me that’s the worst one, but again I’ll get over it 
10/10 recommend it can expand your perception

Update: he said he respects and appreciates me telling him . However he wants us to stay friends and he likes how things are going with us and wouldn’t want to ruin it and that he cares about me! I think this is a soft way to reject me and i feel honestly the smallest amount of embarrassment and a lil upset but overall I’m still super liberated lmao. I didn’t die at his rejection, I feel like I can relax around him now and I think going forward I’m willing to be more direct about what I want and how I feel, I think the more I do it the more my perception of life men people will shift if I’m wrong about certain ideas. I genuinely think I feel more confident anyway I like the bold look on me. I’m having moments of self doubt but their tiny I’m like no I’m sure I’m still hot I’m a great catch even if he don’t want me haha 

And just on that a lot of guys are commenting it’s daunting to ask women out and tell them and wow I am shocked like I always expected men to just do it. I even minimised the fact men also have to deal with feelings of rejection- probably because I’ve been approached a lot in my life and you start to think men know the deal. And I really never thought men would find this daunting because it looks good on you, to be open and approach women etc it makes a man look good most times. I also think how you take it after influences that. I know I respect the guys that take it well, that’s confidence and it probably makes me move more towards mhhh should I reconsider at the back of my head (but don’t bet on it just respect the decision let your character be good). The same guy I confessed to, he really liked me two years ago and I told him I didn’t want to see him I was still getting over my ex and his response really set him apart. Not only did he say that’s okay do what’s good for your mental health, focus on yourself and you have to love yourself so much that you take care of you. He fully respected my decision, didn’t become defensive and he left me alone and even checked up on me a few times! Like is that not a good man, it allowed me to keep him in my life as a friend. Some guys take it too personally and forget the woman is a person! You can still show love and kindness if she doesn’t want you romantically and then move on. That’s incredibly attractive it speaks highly of character. So in short please don’t take rejection too personally it helps.",t7eoip,289,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/t7eoip/i_confessed_my_feelings_to_my_crush_and_id_100/

948,Tired of dating but lonely,"I really need someone to care about me so that I feel I matter in this world the least bit, but apparently every date or relationship turns out to be a great failure. Until 25 I only had 2 short relationships and that was mostly because I tried so hard for them, the partners didn't feel like being together with me. I feel I'm constantly being tested, I have to be amazing from every point of view, I just can't be myself because whenever I am, I am dumped or rejected. 

Just today the girl I was dating texted me she doesn't see us fit together and it's better to stop seeing each other. I asked for feedback and she replied she doesn't get too intimate (kissing, hugs) from the first dates and generally loves more mature men than me. Had I not kissed her, the relationship would've turned into a friendzone. I know that. It's always like this. I either jump into a toxic relationship where I'm the only one who cares or just friendzoned after a while. 

I can't take it any more at this point, dating is too painful to the point I'm losing all motivation to live. It's not the rejection itself, it's the thought nobody ever loved me and probably never will. 

I am living by myself and I'm just a lonely person most of the time but loneliness has its limits. Even as an introvert, I sometimes desire the company of others. When I go out of my way to meet someone, this is what happens. I spent time, money, energy on this without any luck and all I got in return was breaking my will to live.",w1zij4,281,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/w1zij4/tired_of_dating_but_lonely/

We left to go get food, I said I'm just running to the corner shop to get some cigs whilst my girlfriend was with my other two friends (we'll call them John and Mike).

As I left the corner shop, I saw my girlfriend and John linking arms with each other walking toward me,  Mike was stood with them. As I came out she let go of John's arm and ran over to me.

I have said to her I didn't like it because long story short my ex girlfriend girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend, I found out and lost her and all of my old friendship group, so I have some weird issue with my girlfriends getting close like that to my close friends now.

We really hit it off and decided to meet for dinner. She showed up a hour late, which was very frustrating. Turns out she doesn’t have a car and got a ride with her sister and sister’s boyfriend. She was apologetic for it and I shrugged it off. Turns out the sister and boyfriend would be joining us. That was never mentioned. Then first question I’m asked by her was if I liked kids. I felt it was an odd opening question like that, but I do want some in the future so yes. She then says good well I have one and are you okay with that? Mind you this was not mentioned at all on her dating profile, so I was really taken back by it. It’s not a total dealbreaker, but at the same time that should be something you’re forward about. I was uncomfortable about that being asked in front of her sister and sister’s boyfriend. I get it was nerves, but it didn’t sit right with me. 
We have a good amount in common and I feel a connection could be there. At the same time I just feel like there’s something off about everything.

But in our previous conversations, she said that she wanted to be in one. So I took it as she wants to be in one, just not with me. I was fine with it. But she said, she wants us to be good friends. I thought like, yeah this happens in every situation where a girl rejects a guy. She asks him to be her friend. So I said we can't be friends. I also said that she likes me but isn't admitting it, because I had a feeling that she really does like me. She waited for like 10 minutes to think of a reply for that text and she came up with ""I am into someone else"". She could be lying or telling the truth but I didn't care. I stopped talking. It's been a few days, and I got texts from her yesterday saying that she really wants us to be friends forever as I just get her like, really get her. Better than her childhood friends.

A guy came to the table and told me “Hello sorry to bother you but I think you’re beautiful and I was wondering if you could give me your number”

For background: I was wearing sweatpants, a messy bun and just an old tshirt, thinking back, it felt kinda nice that someone found me attractive even in that attire.

But I felt embarrased because he told me right there in front of my family (we’re not that close in that department and do not talk about these type of stuff)

I said to him in a panic: umm thank you for saying that but no thanks.

I felt really guilty because I said that without thinking and just focused on my shame of being asked in front of my family.

Five minutes later I gained some courage and wrote my number on a napkin and gave it to him: I told him “Sorry about that but I was embarrased to be asked in front of my family”

I left the restaurant feeling like I missed an opportunity of meeting someone good, just because I panicked.

He hasn’t texted, I don’t blame him, I probably embarrased him.

tl;dr: Someone asked for my number in front of my family, I rejected him but then later gave him my number in a napkin; feel like I lost my chance because he hasn’t texted, and probably won’t.

958,Stop texting. Call her. See her.,"I’m not saying don’t text at all, but more of your conversation should be in person, or on the phone. 

Texting is way too impersonal. You might even just be one of a bunch of guys that text her. 

Also, every date doesn’t have to be drinks or out to eat. You can meet up in nature. I have pretty cool lakes around me, paths and parks. I think after the 2nd date you should try a place like this. 

To me it’s all about getting that barrier out of the way and really getting to know each other. Killing any nervousness there. There’s no distraction when you’re taking a walk. Lots of time for laughs or a lot of time to see if she’s boring, or always on her phone, has nothing really to say.

959,It’s okay to not be a 10,I have to get this off my chest. I was having a conversation with my sisters and all they could talk about was how they deserve the best men of the world and how they’re 10/10 in their own eyes. So I chimed in and let them know they probably aren’t a 10 to most guys and that their standards were outrageous. Now why is this important? Because you don’t need to be super attractive to be loved or give love. I’m tired of this condescending notion that you need to be a certain level of attractive to be treated decent by other people. An attractive man didn’t treat you like shit because he couldn’t see how pretty you are. Maybe he didn’t like you and he didn’t think you were that attractive. Maybe an average person would treat you better. In this cruel world we prioritize looks and sex way more than we should especially nowadays. So many people will end up alone because of their condescending point of view on dating and relationships. It’s perfectly fine to be average and be with someone average. We are all not 10s. Most of us aren’t above a 7. There’s nothing wrong with being average. Why do we constantly put ourselves on a pedestal only to be humbled by people that are actually amazing?

963,How do I break it off with a gold digger?,"F24 been dating M26 for about a month-ish. Two first date were fantastic but after we got intimate, red flags started popping left and right. He became very wishy washy; inconsistent text replies, telling me he will call me but leaves me hanging for 4-5 days. Funny is when we do meet he would be texting on his phone for 1/4 of the time. Very patronising and arrogant. 

I’ve got quite a bit of holiday for the end of the year and my family have decided to take a long term vacay where my mum originates to spend some time with family we haven’t seen in years. The destination is a popular luxurious tropical island.

Ever since I told him about it. He’s suddenly reverted to being very « charming » and keeps dropping hints (very explicitly) that I should invite him on this family vacay. I told him I was not comfortable with doing that since I barely knew him yet. He completely ignored me and started telling me I should invite him because I owe him as much??? That I should tell my family to host him and pick him up from the airport ?? 

We’ve always split the bill. I’m the one that travels to see him because I live in the suburbs and there’s nothing really to do where I live. (Fuel ain’t exactly cheap these days.) He also on several occasions tells me that I should be bringing him chocolate and wine as his other dates have done so?? Whenever we go by luxury store he’d ask me « Would you buy me that ? Because I’m such a great date, don’t you wan to spoil me? » Ironically he earns three times my salary and his family is defo financially more comfortable than mine. The one time I did get him a bottle of wine as he invited me over for dinner he said « it better be a brunello » (he’s from the region that wine was made) and « i got better reds in my reserve »…

Enough is enough. Now I usually do the « it was great getting to know you but I don’t see this working out » call. Just out of respect. Especially one month into dating. But due to the amounts of times he’s ignored and disrespected me I’m tempted to just ghost him ? Not to mention he’s left me on read again after we had our last conversation.

Tldr: Im taking out the trash. The gold digger is a HIM. I identify as a Her/ She/ woman/ female. He identifies as an « unwashed dick »",z6amdw,277,245,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/z6amdw/how_do_i_break_it_off_with_a_gold_digger/

968,How can I attract a reserved introverted guy?,"I’m a very extroverted and charismatic girl who’s very unexpectedly fallen for one of my introverted and reserved close guy friends. Most people say that he gives off serious reserved vibes but honestly in 90% of my interactions with him, we just laugh with each other a lot. Best thing I like about him is watching how he interacts with others because he brings so much  coolness and peace to people when they do know him. Recently I think we’ve gotten a lot closer because he’s unexpectedly helped me through reclaiming a part of my trauma and for that I’m really grateful for his friendship. I’m putting very little stock into my feelings because I don’t want to get disappointed if the feelings aren’t mutual and frankly I care much more about preserving our friendship whether something develops or not. But I’d still like to know what’s the best thing I can do to perhaps attract him slowly?¿

Edit: Thanks everyone for the helpful and supportive answers. I’ll be taking my time to chew on it. One thing I must clarify is that I’m not despo for a date or relationship in the next 24hrs. The slowness is also for myself to truly figure out how I feel and whether I really want this. Nonetheless thanks for the insightful answers:)

969,"As a guy, it’s so stressful to worry about not being creepy or rude when approaching girls","Does anyone else feel like this? I don’t even mean doing something like randomly going up to people and flirting in a public setting, I mean just talking to girls in social settings where it’s *expected* to talk to people, like in a class or a social event.

Like, even if I just want to be friends with someone I feel like I might come across the wrong way just by introducing myself and starting a conversation. I feel like, sometimes, any person that’s a guy that goes up to someone that’s a girl is automatically painted as evil and full of bad intentions. 

I’m really tired of feeling that way. I don’t want to upset anyone. I don’t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. At the same time, I want to be meeting new people and seeing if I just get along with anyone. It kind of sucks.

Maybe it’s wrong for me to feel that way though and my thoughts are flawed. I’m not sure. All I know is that this is tiring.

EDIT: To anyone that checks this post again — I didn’t expect this to blow up so sorry for not responding to comments. I think I was just really worried and conflicted that night. I love meeting and talking to new people of both genders, even in a non-dating context, but I also felt terrible at the thought of potentially making anyone feel even remotely uncomfortable.

I have a lot of friends, but no one ever introduces me to anyone else so…might just be my friend groups. Like people said, I think if I just keep treating people normally I’ll be fine. The only time I think I’ll have to worry about this is with people I’m interested in, because I know I’ve been awkward/somewhat different in the past. Even then, hopefully if I back off at the right times it won’t be a big deal. Researching into more info about body language/verbal cues also seems like a great idea (even though I think I’m decent at it, becoming amazing at that will probably help).

971,Is it ok to text this after a first date?,"So I (28m) went on a date with a girl (29) yesterday. The date was fine I guess, there were no awkward silence, she laughed a lot (maybe she laughs a lot in general, idk).    When we separated she said she had a great time and gave me a hug.

I didn't ask about or tried to arrange the second date because I do not want to pressure a person, like maybe she doesn't like me and it would make her feel uncomfortable to say no or smth in person.

Then yesterday evening I texted ""How are you?"" Just to show interest etc. She replied only this morning... Which makes me think that maybe she's not that interested because if I liked the date I would wait for a message and check my phone but maybe not because she spent the evening at her friend but still, how much time it takes to look at your phone and reply?

Anyways, today I replied to her something like this:
""Hey, how did you like yesterday? I liked it and I liked you. Do you want to go to a second date? Or am I a ""nice guy BUT...""? :D

I'm this straightforward because I do not want to waste your and my time by pointlessly texting"".
 
It's been 3hours and she hasn't responded yet so I don't expect much from this lol but who knows, I still expect the best but am prepared for the worst.

But my question is: is it okay to be this straightforward and just ask? Looking at my message I now think that maybe everything that went after ""date?"" was not necessary.

I don't want to make same mistakes in the future.

Edit: Thank you for your replies, people. They were not comfortable to read but it's the harsh truth I guess. I done fucked up, I see. And yes, it is true, I have kinda low self-esteem and guess that manifested here exactly. 

Someone said just to not text her again at least until she replies. I won't do that, it's not the first time I don't have a text back but I never come with more texts, I'm not THAT dumb or needy. The worst I have done in this regard was buying premium to see if she has read my message (don't have it now and won't buy). She hadn't text back yet btw so it is what it is.

I think I'll stop OLD for now and will try to work more on myself, my self-esteem.

UPDATE: She replied. Something like 
""Hey, it's really early to speak about liking you or not after the first date but I would have been for going to the second day. But you say that texting with me is a waste of time. So  I will wait for someone who does not feel that way. It's the first time I hear something like this."" And deleted her profile.

972,“Stop Using Dating Apps! Meet people in real life”,"I (F22) HATE when people say I should stop using dating  apps and meet people in real life. How am I supposed to do that? A lot of the socializing I have with friends are with the same people or lack male attendees. The only time I could meet someone new is at the bar or club which usually is a bunch of weird guys trying to get my attention. I go to pharmacy school but there aren’t that many guys and many of them came into the program with relationships. 

I get so frustrated when people tell me to stop because there’s no other way with COVID to just meet someone. In person, my life just doesn’t allow me to mix with people my age aside from school but most people are already in relationships.

I will say that when I was younger, I used the internet to find love because I was bullied for my looks growing up. I found comfort on the internet when dating and I wish I did not do that because it put me into a lot of predatory situations that I am not gonna get into.

I say this to say that it is just hard to find people in real life and I am just getting sad that I am single for the holidays. I mean I’m always single but it hits the older I get. All I get is situationships or unwanted attention. New year? Not even gonna hope for it :/


What do you all think about this? Do you agree or what can I try? BTW: ( I live in a city for school (bit dangerous tho) and a quiet suburb during holiday break …isolated home) have lots of female friends but lack platonic male friends

973,I realize being single is completely my fault,"So I'm a kissless, dateless, 24 year old virgin and I realized to be completely honest it isn't all my fault. I don't struggle with confidence and I don't struggle talking to new people. In fact, I used to have bad anxiety and I took it upon myself to fix it. So I'm doing good for myself. I box, work out, and I'm becoming a doctor. I even have friends. 

However, with that being said, I still struggle massively with women. I use to blame myself until I started to realize that I go harder than most people around me when it comes to self improvement. I put myself outside my comfort zone everyday. But I realize I just don't have alot of social intelligence.

 For example, I never could make it past the first date with women. Alot of people thought I was lacking confidence. Well the truth is I just didn't know what was expected out of a man on a date. I didn't have role models nor alot of friends growing up. This wasnt my fault. I grew up as a only child in a kidless neighborhood. I switch schools every 2 years because my parents felt like i needed better education. So in general, I like a baby trying to understand the world around me. 

It moves very fast and I'm actually doing pretty well as I have my own place, car, and money. But knowing how to act in convos is hard. Sometimes I'm too blunt or other times are too soft. 

Anyways, I wanted make to post to help others realize not everything is your fault. Sometimes its a sucky situation and working past that can be challenging.",z4icx4,270,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/z4icx4/i_realize_being_single_is_completely_my_fault/

975,Met a girl that I is exactly my type but I couldn't get hard,"**Edit: There has been some confusion: like I said at the end I'm not worried about not getting hard again, I know I will perform this time. I was asking advice about setting up the next date with her. 

I [31M] met a lovely and smart girl on Tinder. We talked for 3 hours while walking and after a while we drank some beer at a bar. I got her back to her home and only them we started kissing. She wanted me so badly but I was kinda drunk and I had masturbated before the date, so that eventually led to me not being able to perform. 

I got really depressed bc I made her stay awake at night (she had to work on the morning) and didn't give her pleasure. She also got frustrated. 

We traded messages for 3 days and I finally convinced her to go out again. The first date I wasn't trying, but now I was, and I know that's not good. She had to work on the next morning and this time I just got some kisses on the lips, no tongue involved. 

I believe that I don't need advice in regards to what happened, I already learned my lesson. I look forward to our next date, if it happens. 

Our second date was yesterday, and I didn't text her and she didn't text me since. What would be a good plan? What should I text her till trying to set up a new date? Should I ignore her and wait untill she text me first?",xpran1,266,178,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xpran1/met_a_girl_that_i_is_exactly_my_type_but_i/
976,Virgin kink?,"So I (22 f) met this guy (21 m) online and we really seem to click and we have both been enjoying getting to know each other, talking about all kinds of different things. We both seem to be looking for something serious and are into each other. He has experience and has had past relationships while I have not, and I’ve not slept with anyone either. After we were sharing these things with each other, he admits that my virginity only attracts him MORE to me. He admits it’s somewhat of a kink, which kind of concerns me. He’s not disrespectful or even pushy, and doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable, so I don’t really feel like he’s just trying to warm me up to “deflower” me, but SHOULD I be concerned? Like I mentioned, I don’t have any experience and would hate to put myself into a questionable position and get hurt because I wasn’t smart enough to notice any red flags. 

Does a partner being a virgin make them MORE attractive? I wouldn’t think it really matters as long as they are healthy, but everyone has different turn ons.

977,"A lot of people are single not by their own choice despite doing everything great, and that’s okay.","Seeing lots of single posts about people doing everything they can, going to the gym, good hygiene, etc and can’t find someone. Here’s the problem: dating isn’t a math equation. It’s not you do x for y years and then you’ll find z by this year. Lots of it is luck and that took me some time to realize (single at 21 - edit: though I’ve been in one short relationship). Some people who have had success stories don’t realize that there are many others who didn’t have that: it’s survivorship bias. The reality is there’s a lot of people that died without having success and we don’t get to hear their stories from their friends or kids because they didn’t have any. You think every person that has ever lived in the past had success? No way.

It sucks but going to the gym, hygiene, etc, you need to do for yourself not to find someone. If you do it only for the purpose of finding someone, you’ll get frustrated if you can’t. You may do all these things and not find someone. Now if you do them, you likely will find someone; but if you can’t, it’s still okay and it’s not reflective on you as a person. I have a friend who found someone first try; I’ve had others who haven’t after many tries. It is what it is. But once you give up your success rate is guaranteed 0%.

After that date we talked daily until our second date. He’d send gm texts and all that. Our second date was last Saturday and we went to the beach. After the beach we went to his house and did the deed lol. He had asked me if I was down and pushed for it (not constantly but he had asked a couple of times). I said ya bc i liked him and I felt a connection w him and thought he wouldn’t push back and also I was wanting to do it lol so after we did that and hung out he took me home. He was talking about how I’d see him next week. He’d plan something for us. He even texted me right away the second date saying how much fun he had blah blah fucking blah we talked until like the evening on Sunday and I haven’t heard from him since. The most concerning part is I saw that he changed his profile pics on bumble :/ I get that we did it so early but he hella pushed for it and made it seem like it wouldn’t be a big deal.

979,"28m I dont mind paying for first couple dates, but is there a point where that can stop?","If first date involves drinks or some food, nothing super fancy, then Im fine to pay and offer. Even the 2nd date I'll offer to pay. I think its nice since I am the one inviting them out and it shows I'm not broke.

But by the 3rd date Im thinking why should I continue paying? I guess a 2nd question would be that I'd think it would be good to start including them in plans for dates instead of being completely in charge of it.

Things like appetizers I could continue to pay for or take turns, but we are both adults with jobs and it seems a little old fashioned and silly for me to cover everything. Plus I want them to help decide what we are doing next.

Can this conversation happen at end of 2nd date, if its clear its heading to a 3rd date?

I dont go to fancy dinners for 1st dates, but this past month has been expensive. To many first dates that include drinks and some food. Weeknights and shorter days mean less easy walk dates.

I really like this women Im having a 2nd date with tomorrow and I dont want to make it weird by bringing these things up.

however if the date goes well I'd like to include her in deciding on 3rd date activity and if involves money see if she is willing to spend some.  


Edit: Just fyi, This women Im going on a date with tomorrow never signaled she expected me to pay. I just dont have a lot of dating experience and dont know the mechanics that well.

983,It’s a red flag if it makes you feel uncomfortable.,"I’m seeing a lot of questions on here lately about red flags and I want to share my $0.02 about it. 

I did find a book about red flags, but there is no real checklist to use when dating someone. Dating is hard. We all have different tastes and experiences, and everyone around you is doing the best they can with the personalities they’ve been creating their whole life. 

People will do and say things according to their character and if their experiences were different than yours, they may not react the same way to things as you do. 

A red flag is something that gives you a “gut feeling” that something's not right, intuitively you feel the urge to steer clear.

There are some red flags that we can all agree on. But other, smaller red flags, are personal. It’s up to you to decide if it’s enough of a red flag to cancel that next date.

…and if you are motivated to post about it, there’s a good chance that it’s a red flag",ressol,263,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ressol/its_a_red_flag_if_it_makes_you_feel_uncomfortable/
984,"Do not be desperate for a gf, not because girls have the supposed desperation 6th sense, but to protect yourself from heartbreak","Let me summarize this as much as possible:

Liked a coworker, thought she liked me back, she said that she was not ready for it. Later she told me that she was raped. I felt awful about what happened to her and wanted to show her that I only had good intentions toward her. I tried to get closer to her, but I felt pushback and I started getting annoyed at the extremely slow replies. So, I mentioned that if she thought that I was too intense it would be better to not talk anymore. She got upset that I did want to be her friend anymore. I felt bad that she got upset with me. She said that needed to complete her college assignment because according to her words ""she was fucking her ex all summer and didn't dedicate time to her class"". That was probably the 4th red flag for me by this point. 1st was her getting upset over anything, 2nd was her being extremely slow to respond, 3rd was her belittling me for anything that she didn't consider of her caliber, 5th was she mentioned that everything that I did was a red flag. Well, I wanted her to really like me since I really wanted a gf, so I shut down all my gut feelings and offered to do all the college work for her. So, I was working my full-time job, took all my vacation time to help her, and all my free time, and I would be her cheerleader trying to encourage her because she would always be super sad always thinking that she was going to fail and all of that. Nobody wanted to help her, not her sister nor her ex (even though she was still super duper obsessed with him). So, I wrote a total of 16 journals in 3 months, all of this on top of all her verbal abuse because she had to correct grammar and sentence structure since English is not my native language. However, I did all the research and wrote everything. Later, I would get upset that she only texted me to ask me about the status of the paper and never texted me to hang out or to talk about anything else. To that, she replied that ""You are intense and your intensity scares me"". I was so sick and tired of her. She would have so much time to text and snap with her ex who left her because he didn't want to deal with a girl that was raped but had no time for the guy who was dropping everything else to assure that she graduated and didn't lose her job. Ohh yeah, I forgot to mention that if she didn't complete this class she would lose her job since the diploma needed to be submitted at the end of the semester to not lose employment at the company we work for. So, I was being the idiot who was doing free labor, and whenever I just wanted to quit, she would just guilt trip me with ""I thought that you cared about me"", and then would say with the sweetest voice ""I haven't given away the idea of us being together"". So me being the total idiot that I was I finally finished the class for her and got her an A. Then one week after the class ended she told all our cohort at work that I was a creep obsessed with her, and then she told me that if I ever contact her again she would tell HR about me... I was so brain fucked about what just happened. I just told her how she used me, and she said ""I would never use anyone. I am a good person. You did all of that out of your own free will"". And then she blocked me from FB and said that if I ever contact her through work, she would have me fired. She said that “You did help me, but that still hunts me"", and then she blocked me from FB. Later I realized that she destroyed my reputation at work to make sure that everyone would take her side if I ever complained about what she did to me.

I will always be super angry at her, but definitely more angry at myself for being so desperate for a gf, that I just let someone manipulate me like a fiddle and just threw away logic and my gut instinct just because I really wanted a gf.

TLDR: Forget about desperation being a turn-off. Do not be like me, do not be so desperate for a gf that you get PTSD and anger about someone leading you on for 3 months and then just throwing you into the guillotine, and then saying that it was all on you making everyone believe that you are the bad guy in the story. When everything that you did was help someone and all that you asked in exchange was more of her time to get to know her and form a deeper connection with her.

Edit: I forgot to mentioned that before she blocked me, she showed me her newly created OkCupid profile and told me how she would prefer to date any random stranger than me...

985,Dating a girl with an OF,"I am a divorced male (44) and she (30) has never been married. We’ve been together for over a year (16mo). Honestly, it’s the best relationship either of us have had. We communicate well, she gets along great with my kids. Truth be told, it’s been great. 

She told me that before we dated, she had an OF for a month or so. It made her some money, she had a few special requests and she didn’t mind it. But she did turn it off because she felt she no longer needed it. 

Now she has decided to get it up and running again. She has posted her link in a link tree she has on her Instagram. (And before you ask, I’m not giving it.) She says she needs a budouir shoot because she’s getting new subscribers.  I’m a photographer, and a good one, and she wants me to take the pictures.  

I’m struggling with this. She is very attractive and gets lots of attention. I know of at least a half a dozen guys who would love to date her. Some of these guys are her “friends” that I know pretty well. Some of them occasionally cross the line. I don’t like it but she lets it slide. I have total confidence in her and our relationship. I don’t suspect her of or capable of cheating. 

But this OF bothers me. Guys I know and guys I don’t will be paying & to see my gf naked. (She doesn’t do explicit content. At least not yet.) It’s her body and her right to do this. But, I look at it in certain ways that really bother me. 

If a guy came up to her and said “here’s $5, take off your pants and let me see you butt”, I’m fairly certain she would refuse. But he can do it online. 

If a guy said “here’s $5, let me pleasure myself while looking at you”, she’d refuse. But he can do it online. 

These customers get to pretend, perhaps, that she is theirs. They can fantasize about her naked, but now they can fantasize about more because they have the pictures. 

And some of those customers are her “friends” that she is in regular contact with. At first, I wanted to know who was signing up but now I don’t think I do because I don’t think I want to know who has seen my gf naked. 

There used to be an old joke. “Do you have naked pictures of your girlfriend? No? Want some?”  Now I feel that as she does this, I’ll be the joke. A handful of guys, guys I know, will have naked pictures of my gf. 

I don’t know how to handle this. Anyone out there dating a girl/guy with an OF? And do you know the people who subscribe to their content?",tv2crf,264,334,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tv2crf/dating_a_girl_with_an_of/
986,He mentions that tattoos are a deal breaker 3 weeks after going out with each other.,"Hey guys, I'm trying to understand if I'm justified in feeling a little angry at the situation.

I met a guy last month and we hit it off quite well. He is/was very expressive and affectionate towards me. 

Anyway, the relevant part is: I have pics of me with my tattoo on my dating profile, so I would assume that anyone who matches with me, talks to me, tells me they like/miss me, goes out with me, etc. would be okay with tattoos, so I didn't expect to find myself in a situation where he tells me that tattoos are an absolute deal breaker after going out with me for 4 weeks.

We were casually talking yesterday and it didn't feel like he was 'waiting' to break things off or anything like that. It was a natural flow of conversations where I mentioned that I'm planning to get a small tat, and he was like, ""oh btw tattoos are a deal breaker for me, i just don't like them"" but I didn't think too much about that statement immediately, the topic changed and we were okay. After a few minutes though, I had to ask him how serious he was about that statement. And he just said that it was an absolute thing, but he added that his preference shouldn't stop me from getting more. But it meant that me getting more tats in the future would be a big deal breaker.

Yes, I respect everyone's dating preferences including his' and obviously we broke things off (it was sad and kinda abrupt). But I feel like I should've been informed about this given that it has been a part of me from the start, and can't help but feel like I've wasted my time. Am I right in feeling this way?

edit: we haven't had sex (because we mutually agreed to take it slow) so some of the comments here have become irrelevant.

On one hand, I really want to get the monkey off my back. Being a virgin this late in life has hurt my self-esteem and it bothers me a lot. This girl seems really nice and patient and I think she’d do a good job of easing me into it. Also, there’s a girl at my university that I like who I’ve been making progress with lately. I worry that if I get into a relationship with her, she’ll judge me for my lack of experience, so doing this might help.

On the other hand, isn’t losing your virginity supposed to be something special? Shouldn’t it be done in the confines of a relationship instead of a hookup with a stranger from the Internet? If my future wife asks me how I lost it, I don’t know if I could look her in the eye and tell her about this… Even telling the girl from my university about it would be really awkward

I've gotten a few guys who totally turned off from me when I said I was a teacher. Would you date a teacher? Why or why not?,vcefib,263,378,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vcefib/men_of_reddit_would_you_date_a_teacher_serious/
996,How can I attract decent men and not just ones who want to lay me?? 22f,To keep this straight I mainly meet men in dating apps. The ones in bars aren’t much better and no one really approached me elsewhere in public. I’m an attractive fit girl with a nice personality I think. I can be super flirty but not just with anyone. My love language is touch so guys get the wrong idea when I’m around them but I can’t help it. I’ve been single for 2 years and haven’t had luck with men recently. They always end up leaving even if I don’t sleep with them so I’m at loss here. It’s like as soon as a guy attracts me they disappear. But when I don’t like them they’re around still. What’s up with that and how can I prevent this?? Let me know please it’s affecting my mental health thinking I’m not worth enough for someone to take me somewhat seriously and more than a potential lay for them to cross off their list.,ut3zwi,260,389,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ut3zwi/how_can_i_attract_decent_men_and_not_just_ones/
997,another guy who doesn't listen,"So, I matched with a guy last week and we got to texting. He seemed nice enough and I gave him my phone number. As time went on and we conversed, he kept sending me messages about how he wanted to kiss. Like an annoying amount of times. it got to the point that I started getting really irritated because it's all he talked about. We never talked about literally anything else. I'd ask him how his day was going, he'd say fine, and send the kissy lips afterwards.

Anyway, after telling him again yesterday, he got slightly hurt. He isn't listening at all. So, we were supposed to have a date tonight after work and I really wanted to cancel, but figured maybe I will just see it through.

I sent a text asking if we were still on for tonight at 5:30, and he responded AGAIN with ""yes, we can kiss then."" UGH. SHUT UP ALREADY. ARE YOU DEAF?

I told him I'm no longer interested, he's making me very uncomfortable and I'm tired of mentioning it. I'm now irritated and pissed off. This isn't a good match.

Guys: If a girl asks to you not talk about something, whether it's kissing, sexual innuendos, or whatever else, LISTEN. It makes you look extremely ignorant and RUDE. What a jackass this guy was!",ubny4z,259,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ubny4z/another_guy_who_doesnt_listen/
998,"For the guys out there, you first need female friends.","I see too many guys I know that get caught up in the hunt for a relationship. Every women who is in their vicinity becomes a prospect for them. The issue with this is that women are often put off by this behaviour, and the energy you give off is clear as day. You scare the girl off, she then tells her friends, and the dominos fall. You've now lost any chances with her social group. You start to feel like shit, and start to blame everyone around you and it can really spiral out of control.

This is why I repeatedly tell my friends to take a step back and try to expand their female friend group if they are having a hard time meeting people or find themselves getting shot down left and right. Put aside the need to find a relationship, just look to become friends and nothing more. Find people with similar interests and spin that social web.

There are a number of reasons this will help. You won't come off as someone in desperation or clingy. You'll be in a much better mindset, and can explore what interests you in other people. People will be more comfortable around you, you will be more comfortable around others. Friends talk to friends and will vouch for you. The amount of people you meet exponentially increases as your friends group grows. Not to mention it will help alleviate any nerves you have about being around the opposite sex.

I always see guys complaining about the fact that they never come across women to approach in public. The reason is that they are with their friends, in groups. If you aren't in that group, its going to be really hard to get into those groups if all your looking for is dates/relationships and making a fool of yourself.

Also, as your friend group increases, you'll start running across people in public that maybe you've met once or twice when hanging with friends. You are now at the tipping point, and can start having conversations with people you are interested in dating. Your name is out there, people know, friends will vouch for you.

Best way to finding a partner is to first learn to be friends with whomever you are looking for.

Unless you just want crazy sex, hit the gym and then go get crunked at the club.

Edit: I would never argue that this works 100% of the time, and mileage will vary depending on the person. I would never say find female friends for the purpose of either hooking up with them or hooking up with their friends. Put those thoughts aside and develop friendships. My biggest argument is that making friends with whomever/whatever you are looking for will teach you a lot and help improve yourself for future dates, and a larger social group will help you find more potential partners.",s3wpki,257,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/s3wpki/for_the_guys_out_there_you_first_need_female/
