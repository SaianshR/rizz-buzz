0,"When someone really likes you, it’s effortless.","Just keep this in mind. They text you right away or soon after, they will be excited to make plans to meet you, they’ll flirt and ask you questions, they’ll seem interested in your life.

What they won’t do is be unsure whether they’re free, leave you on read or wait hours to reply, not ask questions and  give you short replies.

Dating should be fun, and with the right person it is. If you find it hard work talking to them and they’re always busy, move on you deserve better",sgcach,11302,508,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sgcach/when_someone_really_likes_you_its_effortless/
1,My father told me this," 

My  father told me this when he walked up on me hiding behind his house  while I was bawling over my fiancée, who I just found out was cheating  on me.

“I  know right now you’re feeling desperate, angry, hurt and alone. And the  first thing you want to do is get revenge, sleep with other people and  hurt someone too. That’s normal. But you shouldn’t do that. Don’t be  like her. Don’t go down that path. You should always fall back on your  best character. Be the bigger person now, and you’ve already won. Feel  the pain for now. In a month you’ll see what I mean. And so will she. So  take your time. Be a good man. You’ll find someone who actually cares  about you. Maybe you’ll be alone, and that’s okay too. But you still  have your life and your character and you can’t throw that away because  of someone else who doesn’t have any.”

I’ve  thought about that every single day for a year now, and it has  propelled me to such strength, confidence, love and happiness.",sseson,8905,256,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sseson/my_father_told_me_this/
2,He said yes! I'm finally got the first date of my life,"UPDATE: Oh my god, I can't believe how many comments and upvotes I got on this silly little post, **THANKS!!!!!!** You guys wanted an update and I actually wanted to share with you what happened last night too. It was SO CRAZY,  I had to take melatonin to fall asleep. This update is long and stupid, but I hope you guys are happy with it.

After I posted this, I made a video call to my mom. I told her I finally had a date and she thought I was lying to her, then she got super excited and called my dad over and my dad was super happy too.

I was so excited after the phone call, and then I realized I didn't have anything to wear on the date, so I drove out and bought a dress. After that I texted him asking when I was going to pick him up and he texted back saying 4pm. I went home and got dressed and drove around because I didn't really want to stay at home, but I really wanted to see him so badly that I parked in front of the bookstore early and waited for him to come out. I think my heart was beating so fast that it was about to explode when I saw him walk out and he was super cute, super cute, super cute!!!!!! I need to stress a million times that **He! Super! Classy! Adorable! Lovely!** Now that I think about it I think my face was probably redder than the Chinese flag at the time lol.

He shook my hand, told me his name, he was very happy to meet me, I think I must have had some problem at that time, because I told him my name again, he laughed and said he already knew. I was so nervous in the car that I didn't talk to him at all, and he was quiet, then he asked me where we were going now, and I said to a restaurant, and he said it was too early, right? I said yes, and then there was another awkward silence. After that I parked in a parking lot and he asked me if I wanted to walk around a bit, I said let's walk around then, and then we walked around that restaurant several times. The whole time I was acting like a dorky goose, which was super weird, and although my brain kept telling me to just calm down and be cool and casual, I didn't think I could do it at all.

After we went into the restaurant, I asked him if he had ever eaten Japanese food before and he said he had. I thought he must have thought I was a weirdo because I asked him out and didn't talk, so he started asking me questions like what have I been doing lately and have I seen the new Matrix movie? I told him I had seen it and it was a horrible movie, even Keanu Reeves couldn't save it, and he instantly got excited and told me what he thought of the Matrix series, and then he asked if I would choose the red pill or the blue pill. Then I told him a bunch of reasons about why I would choose the red pill, and then he touched my hand!!!!!!! He told me he would have chosen the red pill too, told me that choosing the red pill was a philosophical question about existence and consciousness and that he was glad I would choose the red pill. He started talking about the connection between the blue pill and TikTok, and whether antiwork was due to self-awakening or just another cynic's orgy. He moved his chair over to sit next to me and poured me some tea. I asked him if his major was philosophy, and he said he was working on his PhD in philosophy, and that the bookstore was just a part-time job. He started asking me what I thought about feminism and the crisis of masculinity, and I told him that the development of feminism did not mean that male subjectivity was in danger, but that the crisis of masculinity was caused by the double emasculation of men by the patriarchal and class systems. I didn't know what shit I was talking about, but he accepted it, and he went on to talk about so much more stuff that I could understand well or not. He kept talking and I got a little tired of listening but he just couldn't stop finally I reminded him that we had been sitting here for 3 hours.

After we walked out, he told me he didn't really want to go home right now and wanted to walk around. He asked me if I wanted to join him, and of course I couldn't possibly say no! Then we walked around this restaurant several more times. He was quiet and I was quiet, and finally he gave me a long hug as I drove him home.

When I got home, he called me and said he was sorry he had been talking about him the whole evening and he wanted to know something more about me. I asked him when we would see each other again and he said he could be with me all this weekend.

Dear comrades, I did it! I did it! I'm as good as a silly goose but I did it! This is too good to be true, I just can't figure out what the hell I was getting into in the past!

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I took my balls, walked up to him, and asked him if he had time to talk. He agreed and we walked outside of the bookstore. I told him my name, age, and job. I told him I had a crush on him at first sight and invited him to go out with me. He blushed and looked very nervous. I gave him a note with my number on it while I told him he could text me if he agreed and then I left.

A little while later, I got texts from him asking where to go on a date and I told him I would take him to a Japanese restaurant. He told me he was free tonight so we could meet earlier.

I'm shaking right now. I have a date tonight!!!!!

Edit: I can't believe I'm getting so many comments, sorry it's hard for me to respond to them all, but **THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH**. I don't have many friends in life, and you guys are my best friends right now!

3,(22 F) Why does every guy my age want a threesome?? God it’s so fucking annoying! Men please share why you think that’s fun or attractive?!,"If one more guy asks me I might snap. A guy I’ve been talking to for a month asked me about myself and a friend last night; while ex boyfriends have brought it up in the past. To this recent guy, I said, “what if that was me asking about your friend” and he immediately said sorry. SO…….. why do so many guys want it, yet wouldn’t be cool with reversing the role? I don’t even want to but it makes more sense thinking about it that way.

Edit: Damn this blew up. Lol. I was not trying to shame people for liking that stuff. Just trying to get some insight into the male mind :)

Another edit: He knows I’ve been cheated on before. That I’m very loyal in nature. Said he DOESN’T care about sex that much.

4,She cancelled our date because of my zodiac sign,"I’m a bit thrown off by this, but I was cancelled on due to my zodiac sign. Throughout the week before work, I visit a coffee shop. I go practically every weekday, and I’ve been seeing the same barista there every morning. We seemed to click well with our small conversations, and after chatting with her for a few weeks, I decided to offer my number, since she was on the clock. She declined to take my number, but gave me her Snapchat. We chatted a bit on Snapchat and agreed to go on a date Friday. About an hour after that, she said she wouldn’t be able to go out with me because she saw on my snap profile that I was an Aries. She said she doesn’t date Aries but it was nice meeting me. 

Is this something that is common in the dating world? I’ve never been rejected over my zodiac sign before so it kinda surprised me.

Edit: I didn’t expect this many replies in an hour LOL. I am trying to go through the responses.",s7g0gm,7155,786,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/s7g0gm/she_cancelled_our_date_because_of_my_zodiac_sign/
5,"Ladies, sleeping with him on the first date or early on does not impact how he feels about you.","I’ve held out for several dates with men to show them I’m not easy and taken home men on the first night. After a few years of doing both, there seems to be almost no correlation between how soon you sleep with them and how seriously they take you.

6,Am I [M35] the asshole for giving a Irish Goodbye to my date [F37]?,"Matched with this lady on Hinge and the conversation went really well. She even said, ""I'd love to get to know you more."" So, I asked her if she was free last night and we agreed to meet up at 8. Says she's running late and we push the time back twice, we're now meeting at 9. 

I get to the bar, on time and text her, ""I'm here."" She tells me to go to the bar next door because that's where she's at now. *Weird, she really hyped up the place we agreed on, but okay.*  

I get there and there's a woman that looks like her. She's having a chat with with 3 older men (all in their mid 50's). Her and I lock eyes and I ask if she's Katie. She says ""yes"" and tells me to go get a drink. She then literally turns her back on me and continues talking to Old Guy #1. I try and make awkward conversation with Old Guy #2 to my right. I don't know these people, she didn't introduce me to any of them. Maybe they're her coworkers she ran into or something. For about 10 minutes my date just continues to ignore me. 

I excuse myself to go to the bar and order a drink. It's busy and it takes about 10 minutes to get my order. I walk back to the table and my date turns to me. We talk for about 2 minutes and then she turns her back to me again to talk to Old Guy #1. He's telling her a riveting story about his March Madness picks /s. I'm left staring at the back of this girl's head. 

For a bit of background, I don't struggle getting dates. I don't struggle getting second or third dates. I'm told I'm an affable, charming and attractive dude. Not that it really matters, but Old Guy #1 isn't a Roger Sterling gray-fox, he's more of a Cam Tucker. Never in my wildest dreams would I show up late, change plans without communicating and then ignore the person I actually made plans with. I would NEVER do that to a date. 

I drain my drink and give a good ol' Irish goodbye. On my way home I get a text from her asking me to come back. I respond by saying that a date with 3 random dudes I don't know was not the plan and that she literally turned her back on me. She replies saying, ""I'm not a shitty person. I don't even know these guys and they're old enough to be friends with my dad lol."" I respond by wishing her the best of luck finding what she's looking for and to have a good night. I go home, order a pizza and play video games. 

At the time it was pretty insulting to have my time wasted like that. Am I the asshole for taking off?",ti3d2p,5343,451,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ti3d2p/am_i_m35_the_asshole_for_giving_a_irish_goodbye/
7,I approached a guy at the bar today,"I (F) went for a drink alone tonight, saw a pretty good looking guy sitting with his friends, felt like talking to him so I mustered my courage, went to his table when he and his friends were kind of chilling on their own, not talking to each other. I asked ""Hi, I saw you from across the room and I just want to talk to you, do you mind?"", to which he said ""Sorry, I'm with my friends."". I smiled, said I got it and wish him a good night then went back to my table. I felt so proud of myself, like the fact that I tried asking him was all that matters, whether his answer was yes or no (though it'd have been better if it was a yes). I am neither bitter at rejection nor tormented with what-ifs and this feels so nice.

8,I’m a woman who gives men flowers and they love it,"Last night I (28F) went on a first date with a guy (29M) and I brought him a bouquet of flowers. He was flabbergasted and said no one’s ever given him flowers before. He kept looking at them, then at me and saying “I can’t believe you got me flowers!” And he spent the rest of the night grinning like a fool.

Many years ago I read an article/poll that said over 50% of straight men would actually enjoy getting flowers from a woman, and most of these men even had a favorite type of flower. Maybe it’s a power move on my part, but I’ve given a few different men flowers over the years and they all absolutely loved it.

Normalize giving men flowers.

9,Should I (23M) tell a girl (25F) I saw for three dates that it’s her looks that are making me end it?,"So I have gone on three dates with a girl from Bumble because she’s nice to me and we had interests in common. Since the beginning I wasn’t that much attracted to her physique, but I wanted to go on dates to see if there would be a spark that would make it worth it to pursue dating her even if I don’t find her very attractive.

That said, today I went on the third date and at the end of it, combined with the other two dates, I made up my mind that I didn’t want to go further with her. I proceeded to tell her because I thought it was better in person than over text. 

She kept pressuring me to know what it was that was problematic. I kept telling her that we just didn’t go along well enough for me to be still interested.

My question is: should I have been honest and told her that her looks were the reason? 

I don’t see the point in hurting her with such a statement, and frankly, I’m not Brad Pitt, therefore it could happen to me someday and it would hurt a lot to hear.",r8zcyi,4982,158,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/r8zcyi/should_i_23m_tell_a_girl_25f_i_saw_for_three/

11,Date got up and left in the middle of a sentence,"I am kind of in a state of shock right now, I have no idea what just happened. I was on a date with this girl, we had a couple drinks and had been talking for a couple of hours. She was in the middle of saying something then she looked up and just grabbed her phone and left the table 

She came back ten minutes later and was like “I’m going home, it was nice meeting you.”

I was like “uhhhh are you okay??” and she was like “what? Oh… yeah…” and she got up and left 

I really have no idea what to even think about what just happened. It wasn’t an instant love connection but it wasn’t anything “leave in the middle of a sentence” worthy. That’s never happened to me before

EDIT: She texted me a couple hours later apologizing. She said she just broke up with her ex a few weeks ago and he walked through the door with a new girl and she became very emotional and panicked and didn’t know what else to do but leave. She said she had a nice time though. I said I’ve been there before, and I wish her the best.

As a woman, I cannot recall the last time I regret saying something. There is a 90% chance he’ll flat out say yes, and if not he absolutely 100% will be appreciative. Every single guy I’ve ever talked to has said they would love a woman making the first move.

15,PSA for Men: STAY AWAY FROM DATING APPS IF YOU VALUE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH," **Long Post!!**

In this post, I'm going to talk about how dating apps destroy confidence and self esteem, and essentially dig a grave for yourself to hop right into.

First of all, let me make this assumption: You're an average looking guy. You're not the ugliest kid on the block.. but you're also not the giga chad at the gym. Just... average. If you were a 10/10, then this advice probably wouldn't apply to you, but most of us are average. That's what average means, most of us fall into that category.

You decide, ""You know what? I'm tired of being lonely. I'm creating a Tinder profile"". Little do you know, you've just signed yourself up for great disaster. And here's why:

Online dating apps are a LOSING game for *most* guys. You, most likely, will end up more lonely and sad than before! Start by looking at the statistics:

**OVER 75% of users on Tinder are male!**

Imagine you and 2 other guys approach the same girl to try to ask her out... how would that make you feel? Now.. imagine you go to some dating event... and there are 25 girls and 75 guys... and all the guys are competing for those girls... Do you feel confident in your abilities? Oh, and let's pretend that 7.5 of those guys are extremely good looking (10%, I pulled that number out of my ass. I can't find the statistic to how many guys on tinder get a ton of swipes, but I'd guess the number is 10%).

And as a result, here are some of the things that can happen:

1. You don't get any matches (or a very few amount).
2. The matches that you do get, the girls don't really respond. Even after you spend an hour searching for the best pickup line, they just don't bite.
3. If they do respond, they'll probably disappear after a while

And what's the end result of this?: **You feel so shitty.** You ask, ""Why aren't girls responding to me?"", ""Why aren't I getting any matches?"", ""Am I really ugly or something?"". And all of a sudden, subconsciously, your self esteem and confidence PLUMMET. You think, ""If girls aren't swiping on me on a dating app, then how will I EVER be able to pick up a girl in real life?"". Your confidence takes a massive hit...

and worst of all:

It's not even true! You're not ugly, you're a good guy, and you do deserve it! The issue is, the numbers are so heavily stacked against you! That same girl that you spent an hour thinking of the perfect first message, is probably getting messages from 50+ other guys at the same moment. She probably didn't even see your message!

Just read this excerpt from an article where a guy created a fake woman's profile to see what it was like, ""\[Thomas\] made a profile of a girl named Simone and viola! Three days later, he had already received over 400 messages which indeed were an eye-opener for Thomas.""

**400 messages in three days.** But because you were under the impression that she thought you were ugly... your confidence now tanked.

Conclusion: Stay away from online dating apps. It's a slippery slope for men, and you can suffer a drastic hit on your self esteem and confidence, thus making the probability of you meeting a girl even slimmer. **You have MUCH better odds cold approaching a girl at the library, than downloading some shitty dating app**. Instead of the above example of 3 guys approaching 1 girl... it's 1 guy approaching 1 girl. I like those odds, what about you?

And.. if you get rejected in real life, normally the girl is really kind about it: ""I have a boyfriend"", or ""I'm not interested"". That is a lot easier to cope with, rather than being ghosted by countless girls on an app. And, just approaching the girl in the first place is a confidence booster!

**TLDR**: Over 75% of the users on Tinder are male. If you're an average looking guy, your odds of success are slim. As a result, you will most likely experience very few matches/responses from girls. This can directly impact your self esteem, confidence, and mental health because it gives the perception that girls think you're ugly... when it's not true in fact. They're just bombarded with hundreds of messages from other guys. You have better odds cold approaching girls, and even rejection can still lead to a boost in confidence because hey... you tried, most don't.",sq4ugu,4282,400,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sq4ugu/psa_for_men_stay_away_from_dating_apps_if_you/

I have been talking to a guy (21) and we had our third date at my place last night. We had mutually agreed days beforehand that the deed was probably gonna happen and it did. During the first three minutes, the guy slaps me on the face and my eyes widen and my mouth opens in shock, and before I could muster out a word, he slaps me again 3x harder. The sound it made made my body revolt and I sat up and proceeded to have a panic attack. My date looked confused and apologized but his excuse was that i was okay with choking but my appearance looked like “I was the type to enjoy it rough”. The rest of the night was off and he even seemed disappointed that I didn’t want to have sex with him before we went to bed.

It was super embarrassing and I feel bad. There was blood everywhere and his sheets are definitely destroyed.

He was really chill about it but of course it was kind of a mood killer.

What should I do?

21,He made me go half on the first date,"I (24F) met this guy on hinge (32M) and he invited me out to dinner. He chose the time and place. We made it there and it was a 30 min wait so he suggested getting a drink at a bar across the street. 

We ended up getting our appetizer there too since the wait was a bit long.  I offered to pay for the drinks ( didn’t think he would let me) but he said it’s ok I could pay for the next (dinner I guess !?!). The drinks and appetizer was 45, he paid.

We made it to dinner and it rounded up to about 70, I paid.

This is extremely unattractive to me only because it was a first date. He knew he would get me to pay for dinner and ordered MORE appetizers and lots of extras. 
He chose the place and initiated the date but I ended up paying.

Outside of this the conversation was ok.
Honestly the monetary portion of the date threw me off and was pretty gross to me. I’ve never had that happen.

He texted me but I haven’t texted back, I think I’m no longer interested.

23,Lost my virginity and feel horrible,"Lost virginity and feel horrible, It was just awful. I was crying after and idk what's wrong with me. I’m sick right now my neck and full body hurts. He came down to our
house so we could wal dog outside and watch the sunset. We went back to his house to grab his friend for their soccer game. before that though he basically pushed me down on his dick when he knew i wasnt feeling well. He was so rough and choking and spanking me. and like 2 min later like threw us off the bed to go to his game. it's my fault bc i never verbalized no and i also allowed it. It takes two to tango but I guess I expected him to treat me more respectfully or make sure it was a loving and caring experience. it was the opposite. he left me to cry. it felt like crap bc he was so rough when im that sick and then like we had to leave right away. Just a horrible and not a caring way to experience sex for the first time. 

“I needed it,” he said but it’s my body not his and his forced it and his knows it. I feel violated and used. 

And all I get from him is
“you’re not really a virgin,” and 
“what do you want me to say,” and,
“so you don’t want to talk huh?” and 
“Thanks for giving it to me.” 
Like it’s no big deal to him. 

The more I think about it the more upset and angry I feel. He knew how I felt about virginity and how special it was. I feel so much regret and emptiness. I feel so alone and I don't know what to do, we've been dating six months. He was selfish and he ruined that first experience for me. He made me feel like all the years I spent holding onto something special were wasted,
like they meant nothing. 
He doesn't respect how incredibly hard it was for me to maintain that piece of myself and for it to happen that way. He even called me after saying how much he regrets what happened and how guilty he feels. He said he wishes he could take it back, he said I'm sorry for going to the game after. I told him I need space to process what happened. I don't know what to do

TLDR: boyfriend of six months took my virginity and i feel worthless. both in our early 20's. He isn't a virgin and was sick of waiting, he always brought up how it was damaging our relationship and he needed it. i always made sure to help with other things because i knew how it affected him. Didn't comfort me at all about the situation and fought with me on the ride home

24,I didn’t enjoy my first time,"24 M, I hooked up with a girl last night and she knew this was my first time. She was very kind and tried to keep me comfortable. She was able to get to the orgasm as well. But I couldn’t cum and i feel it might have to do with the fact that watching porn has set unreal standards in my head. 
She wants to meet again. I’m confused as I don’t know how common is it for a guy to not cum on his first time. 
Should I meet her again and try once more? Or should I message her that I need to take a break from sex?

25,Do guys ever fantasize about women in a loving type of way or is it always sexual,"What I mean is… if I find a guy attractive and interesting, I, as a women, naturally gravitate towards fantasizing about love/ the depth and mystery of the person.

26,Why it's important to have female friends as a single guy,"Okay so tonight I was hanging out with my friends at a local bar when a group of 4 girls stationed themselves rather close to us. My friends were all taken and had their S.Os with them except myself being single. Naturally they were egging me on to make a move on the cutest girl of the bunch. Approaching a group of girls that large is quite daunting so I was quite reserved up until one of my friend's girlfriend we'll call her Ashley informs me that she had noticed the cutest girl of the group throwing glances at me and I should definitely talk to her.

I noticed those looks too but didn't think much of it cause we were close to the group and I simply assumed she was just looking in my general direction so it didn't register to me that she may have been interested in me up until Ashley pointed that out to me. So I decided why not? And waved at her. She waved back with a really cute smile and then gestured to Ashley in a way as if she was non verbally asking if we were together. Ashley responded by pointing to her boyfriend and the cute girl nods in return. 

I looked to my friend wondering what just happened. She laughably goes ""she thought we were together and I just pointed to Jake soooo now you HAVE to go talk to her or you're gonna break that cute girl's heart"". I grabbed my drink and approached her. Here's were the real fun begins.

Her: ""You guys aren't together??""

Me: ""No no that's my friend. Her boyfriend is right there.""

Her: ""Ohhh okay! Like I didn't wanna entertain anything while your girlfriend is standing literally next to you haha!""

Me: ""Yeah no you're fine. Honestly I wouldn't even be talking to you right now if it weren't for her. I just didnt think you'd be interested.""

Her: ""Well I assumed you two were together. I was trying to be slick about it but obviously failed miserably haha""

This is the very reason why I think it's important to have female friends, especially if you are single. They have a keen eye in noticing hints that women toss towards men since they do the exact same thing! It's much easier for them to spot it on the fly.

**Edit: For those asking why I didn't immediately text her, I made this post very late at night. I have since texted her and waiting for a response. I'll make an update soon. Thanks for the funny replies** 😁

**Edit: Some of you wondered why I used the word female but not male under the same context. I wrote this late at night and it just went over my head. My apologies**

**Update: She texted me back but doesn't believe i am single... not sure what to do now lol**

**TLDR: Females are good at spotting hints that other females throw at men who they find attractive. Going out with female friends when single will allow you to have an easier time spotting those hints through their lenses**",u4urjo,3507,208,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/u4urjo/why_its_important_to_have_female_friends_as_a/

In the past I have def tried to make plans with women i was interested in and have been told Im just ""busy"". Turns out, nothing ever happened with them. Probably cuz they were not interested and just being nice and trying not to reject me. 

Fast forward to my current situation, There is a girl Im seeing, and she really is busy as hell, just started a brand new career working 12 hrs shifts, has her kids 3 days a week, and is eating right, hitting the gym, and going thru therapy working on her depression/issues. She has told me she cant hang due to work or having the kids, but the words ""too busy"" have never came out of her mouth and she is finding/making time to hang out with me, or even just something simple like playing a silly game online together for 30 minutes. Ppl will make time for ppl they are interested in. 

Too bad my brain keeps trying to convince me otherwise due to my traumas and issues. But Im trying and keeping that all to myself cuz I know its my issue.

29,Why hasn't he kiss me?,"I (32F) met a lovely man on Tinder (35M) and hit it off immediately. We have gone on about 5 dates lasting at the minimum 6 hours each. He texts me every single morning with a good morning video. He checks in multiple times in the day. He is always saying how he's thinking about me and wants to spend time with me. He has sent me flowers and is a total gentleman but.... He hasn't made a single move. Not even hand holding. He will hug me a lot but that's all. I'm so confused and I'm afraid to mess it up by moving faster than he wants to. Why hasn't he kissed me??? or even gotten close? I'm worried I'm friend zoned. I really like him. How do I move things along without freaking him out?


Edit: You all are right… I shouldn’t be waiting on him to make the move I have two lips as well. He’s the first person that has made me butterfly nervous and shy ever. I guess I was just worried that I would mess things up (which as one commenter mentioned is what he might be worried about as well). This is my first time single in 10+ years and a lot has changed (me too for instance),so tomorrow when we make dinner together I’m just going to do it. I’ll update you all after. Thank you guys so much for the advice.

Edit2: The date is tomorrow January 15th and I’ll update right after.

Update: I kissed him!!! I just came home from our 15hr date. While making dinner I asked him why he hasn’t tried to kiss me. He said he wanted to make sure I was comfortable with it and said that he was worried he might mess things up between us if I didn’t want to kiss him back. That he was having such a great time with me he didn’t want to chance turning me off…And like most of you predicted he then asked “well why didn’t you try and kiss me?” I responded with I really want to kiss him and I asked him if I could and then I did.

(Otherwise the post would ended up being too long. Recommend you go to that post before reading this one)

I'm so happy, she is my girlfriend now.

I didn't gave her an ultimatum, I just told her how the situation made me feel and she deleted her OF.


 I told her that a part of me was insecure of starting a relationship with her but another part of me felt it was unfair to make her change for me.


 Then she told me that she had no idea how I was feeling and that I should have told her before. 
 She told me that I changed some behaviours I had that made her feel insecure (like talking to two of my ex-girlfriends) and she reminded me how important and valuable I am and that her OF isn't even close to be important. 

 I was afraid of having to let her go. I feel so relieved now... Remember to always communicate your insecurities with your partner, don't be afraid of the outcome.

 So happy ending I think.

35,Don’t Forget to Date Yourself,"Today I(27f) took myself on a date to the local zoo alone (I am single). I took my little head phones, got a beer or two, enjoyed a lunch, some ice cream, beautiful weather, a cute souvenir, and for the first time ever I got to see nearly all the animals. I’ve been going to this zoo all my life and never had this experience, usually it’s pretty miserable and I can’t stand it. 

Though at times I had people look at me, it didn’t feel bad or awkward. I’m happy I took myself out for once. I didn’t wait on someone to go with me, whether that be friends or some guy. I treated myself and I felt and feel great. 

My advice is to take yourself out and enjoy yourself. Don’t wait on others. Life is too short to be waiting. Plus, you may meet your person at one of the places you treat yourself too! But please go out and enjoy yourself. Don’t be afraid. Next stop is a theme park alone once it opens up for the summer!

39,You talk yourself out of sex when you bring it up too soon.,"Please respect a person's boundaries. 

I get it. We all love to get it in. But unless the other person has stated they're only looking for something casual, talking about sex too soon will most likely ruin your chances at getting any. 

I just started talking to a new guy and it was going okay until he said he couldn't wait to give me head. I asked not to talk about sex or anything intimate until we've met. He kept going. 

""I'm not that type of guy. It's hard not to talk about it because you're so pretty. I can get sex from anyone. If all I wanted was sex you would know. I'm not like all those other guys.""

Okay so why keep bringing it up? Continuing to bring it up means:

- you have no respect for my boundaries

- you're only interested in sex with me

- you ARE DEFINITELY like the other guys

- you aren't safe to be around because you care more about what you want vs what is comfortable for both of us.

- after POST NUT CLARITY, you're going to have a ""realization"" that you didn't want a relationship and the girl shouldn't have expected it BLA BLA BLA.

My advice: respect a person's boundaries. It's not hard.

Me and this guy DON'T talk anymore. My purpose here is to remind everyone RESPECT SOMEONE'S BOUNDARIES. Yes I easily cut him off, but that DOESN'T excuse his pushy and rude behavior. There are people like that who have harmed others because they couldn't get what they want.

This advice will never go out of style.

EDIT: I'm not saying talking about sex is bad. I'm saying if you really want to get to know someone, you need to respect their boundaries and be honest about what you're really looking for.

43,Your Significant Other is a direct reflection of your self respect.,"I’m sorry but too many people come to this sub and tell their situation with their SO and it’s ridiculous how a lot of people don’t understand how their self respect and self worth ties into relationships. I’m mainly speaking to my girls here bc I’ve noticed that men are very quick to leave a woman where she got him fucked up at.

Y’all give your SO many chances at disrespecting you but you know that if it was one of your friends, you would have been cut them off. How do you think you look when your man consistently calls you out of your name and you haven’t put him in his place the very first time he started that shit? You let one thing slide and they’ll start ice skating. What the fuck do you mean by your man has cheated on you and you’re still staying in that relationship?! If a man cheats on me, that’s a straight up ghost from my end. He’ll never see me again.

When it comes to acts of disrespect that he commits the first time, and you don’t see it as valid enough to break up with him immediately, PUT THAT MAN IN HIS PLACE RIGHT THEN AND THERE. Let him know that if he was to ever try that shit again, you’re out. This doesn’t count for cheating. If a man cheats, you must leave that relationship immediately with no hesitation. If you don’t live with him and you don’t have any ties to him, straight up ghost. Especially if he doesn’t know that you know about his cheating. You don’t owe him an explanation for why you left. His presence should absolutely repulse you if he’s a cheater.

It hurts when I see women settle for less. Babes, fix how you view yourself. Stop inviting random people to singlehandedly mess up your life. Have boundaries and be extremely quick to leave when he serves you no purpose but is rather draining you. I want better for all my girls this year. Y’all need to do better.

45,Date went on a fat shame rant. Need help with responding,"So I had a very strange dating experience and I don’t know how to respond to this person? And I really want to…so help me out here! 

I (31f) matched with this person (35m)on bumble and he came down to see me (we live in different cities). I could tell he is very into me right away and he knows a lot of things about me -the details of which I dint necessarily share with him…my work/which other cities I work in/a little bit about my family/he found out we had common friends and asked them for my number…I found this a bit strange but decided to overlook it. We had a normal first date. 

Our second date became really strange. We met over dessert and he went off on a nutritional rant about how sugar is basically poison…all while I was eating a piece of cake. He then went on about how the concept of body positivity is trash and every “fat person” is unhappy. It was horrific for me to hear. I’m a fit and healthy person, I weigh 123lbs and I’m 5’5 so I dint get where this was coming from? He then told me it wasn’t directed at me because he won’t go on a date with someone who isn’t fit. I feel very objectified and strange. It gives me very “you’re not like other girls” type of a vibe. I couldn’t articulate my views fully because I’m very non confrontational. 

After the date, he kept texting me to make plans to meet again. I brought up the “fat”rant that he went on to which he replied “I think you’re doing well but if you gain weight, that’s a problem. Please don’t get fat 😬” 

I literally do not care for his validation or his awful views and I need help drafting a reply that isn’t rude but stern. This is so outrageous! I can’t believe it.

*Edit*: Woah! This blew up. 

I have decided to ignore/ghost him. I don’t want to engage with this behavior and get into arguments etc. not worth it. But some of the suggested responses are hilarious! Thank you! 

I don’t think it’s about his preference of dating fit women being the problem. But how he put down and spoke condescendingly about a certain section of people. That’s unnecessary. He could’ve just kept it to his preferences. I don’t think life is as black and white as being fat/skinny. I’ve had body issues in the past…I was bulimic for a very long time; I’ve not eaten for days altogether and went about my life with body aches and dizziness and that’s another reason why it triggered me I think. It’s been a year since I’ve recovered and not judge my body for it’s size but to strive to be Healthy. Also it’s just super judgey, man…gaining/losing weight isn’t just about fitness-there are so many other factors in life that influence it. 

About the stalking- I asked him why he went to the lengths to do all this digging to which he said he’s just “curious”. I think he wanted me to feel impressed by how much he’s pursuing me? It’s only in my therapy session did I realize this is stalker-ish behavior. Jeez. 

About how he looks- He’s not fat but he says he hasn’t been to the gym in a couple of years and that this is the unhealthiest/fattest he has been. 

Thank you everyone for your input and help and support! I think my reaction isn’t an exaggeration. His attitude is terrible and I think its just so random to tell your date the second time you meet them to not get fat and rant about sugar while on a dessert date.",t6terp,2757,529,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/t6terp/date_went_on_a_fat_shame_rant_need_help_with/
46,We had bad sex on the first date and she ghosted me after.,"I went on 2 dates with a girl. On the second date, she invited me to hers and we had sex. 

**Edit: in the title I said first date but I meant to say second 

Admittedly, I wasn’t very good because it was only my second time having sex and I was nervous. That being said, it wasn’t **awful**, it just wasn’t good. We made out, I engaged in foreplay - I fingered her and ate her out (but I probably wasn’t very good since I’d never done these before). We then had sex. I lost my erection twice but I gained it back as we swapped positions. We finished by fingering her again and making out. 

She ghosted me the next day and it’s been 3.5 weeks since I heard from her despite reaching out.

I don’t feel good at all about myself right now

1. All my past dating experiences have basically been rejections after the first date or just a lack of interest in a first date at all 
2. I’ve never had a girl I like actually like me back - this was the first time even if it was just 2 dates it really hurt to just be ghosted.
3. I’m obviously feeling very insecure right now. It was my second time having sex so I didn’t expect to be amazing. I had a random Tinder hookup once over a year ago which I didn’t learn anything from. 

Has anyone ever had anything similar happen to them? What would you do to try and stay confident? 

Honestly, any stories or advice would help right now. I feel really bad, embarrassed and unconfident and I don’t have anyone else to ask.",sqtesg,2749,597,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sqtesg/we_had_bad_sex_on_the_first_date_and_she_ghosted/
47,Dating as a man is so expensive,"Just got into the dating world for the first time (I've been in relationships but never been in a ""dating lifestyle."")

Fuck its expensive.

I've got 3 dates this week (I know, humble brag, but that's not the point). It makes me realize how low investment it is for the girls. I'm not blaming women at all, I realize this is just how it works and none of us got to decide how society is set up. But seriously, I've got to pick the place and *pay.* These girls just get to show up for free and decide if they like me.

If none of these girls work out, or if they just realize they don't like me, it's like oh well at least they had a good time. For me its like fuck I just spent $300 on people I'm never going to see again.

Anyone got some advice on low-cost dates that are fun but a little cheaper for a first date? I was thinking of like rock climbing or something.",wdmfdl,2644,380,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wdmfdl/dating_as_a_man_is_so_expensive/

Then he wanted to bring me a drink. So I had to tell him no, yet again.

But asking the entire gender why all the ones you’ve met are that way will not accomplish anything. I don’t know what those other men are thinking. My girlfriend doesn’t know why the women you meet think that way.

Because regardless of your experiences, there are a lot of men who would love to help their woman get off. There are lots of women who are a head taller than you guys who think you’re more than good enough.

53,Is friends with benefits a lie? Or am I just creating my own problems because I eat them out?,"The last 4 women I’ve casually “dated” have all ended up falling in love with me in a short period of time. This happens despite me being very clear about not wanting anything serious from the start. As soon as they confess love for me, I stop seeing them because I don’t want to lead them on.

All 4 situations went like this…. Hung out a couple times (drinks, dinner, concerts etc) without any sex. By the 3rd or 4th date, we’re having sex and I go always down on these women because I’m into getting them off. That will last for two or three months before they admit to being in love with me. It sucks because I’m breaking their hearts and then I have to find someone else to casually date. It’s frustrating and I feel like a jerk.

To add some more context, I take them on dates, I usually pay the bill, open the door for them, complement them, and we do cool shit together. To top it off, I am a religious clam licker and think this may have something to do with my problem but who knows. Even though I have been overly clear about my intentions, I can see how they may interpret all of this as the old saying “Actions speak louder than words”.

My goal is to continue casual dating without breaking hearts so what should I do differently?


EDIT: I’ve learned that this isn’t everyone’s definition of FWB. Majority rules says this is dating. Majority rules also says it’s probably not the licking the bean that’s causing the problems….. New question….. Seafood buffet aside, is there a middle ground between dating and friends with benefits? I.e. dating with no strings attached? There has to be people out there who want the same thing that I do…… I can’t be the only one out here on oyster island.

54,"If you don’t work on your insecurities, you will burn every partner you have to the ground.","You’ll always be expecting constant communication, reassurance, attention, praise. You’ll demand that you see each other more, talk more, go on more dates. You’ll keep testing them, manipulating them, to make them prove to you that they love you. And no matter what, it’ll never be enough; because you’re expecting them to fill a hole that you’re too afraid to do the hard work to fill yourself. 

On the flip side, they’ll get burned out, wondering why, even with all they do, that “it’s not enough”. There’s only so many hours in a day to work, sleep, fulfill their basic daily needs, and they’re going to get resentful that you’re demanding of more and more of their energy, time, space, and money; like you’re trying to control them.

Far too many people who are emotionally immature/unable to cope with unhealthy thinking patterns are out there dating because they think someone else can “complete them”. And it’s going to destroy relationships and leave both parties resentful and jaded.

56,Guy I was talking to initiated sex and then got mad after I had sex with him,"i (19f) had been talking to this guy (19m) for a month and a half. we had both expressed a lot of interest in each other and even though we hadn't explicitly talked about it i was under the impression he wanted a relationship.

the last time i saw him, we started drinking and one thing led to the next. like the title says, he initiated things and was honestly way more into it than i was. not to say that i wasn't into it, i was just hesitant since it was our first time together.

i went home that night upset that i had allowed that to happen. i hadn't wanted to have sex that soon and was worried it may have ruined things. i told him how i felt and he reassured me that everything was fine and that he liked me just as much as he had before. and everything WAS fine until yesterday.

i could tell something was off so i decided to ask him what his intentions were. not only did he tell me he didn't want a relationship (and was confused how i even thought he did), he had apparently also been upset that we had had sex that soon but decided to COMPLETELY BLAME ME for it. 

in his own words, he said if i hadn't rushed having sex with him there was a possibility we could've dated but since i had, the possibility was gone. as if he wasn't the one that came onto me?? **as if sex isn't a 2 person act??**

he refused to accept his participation in it, repeatedly saying he had never wanted it to happen and that he just didn't know how to say no. mind you this guy is at least twice my size, so it's not like i had any power over him. he also initiated every single thing we did and was praising me the whole time, so he never showed any signs of not being into it.

i'm just completely blindsided and shocked that he would act as if i forced him into doing something when he came onto me in that way and i told him almost immediately after that i was upset it had happened. i feel like it's obvious that he's manipulating and gaslighting me but i just don't get why, everything was going so good it's like a switch just went off in his head

this is definitely one of the more fucked up things that has happened to me recently and i just don't really know how to feel. any support would be appreciated LOL

59,Got maced.,"
As the post says, I (27m) got maced tonight. First time and it sucks. I got invited to go out with a couple coworkers. I’m not a big drinker, had 1 drink and was completely sober. Well one of my coworkers is a regular and knows a bit about the people that go. 

Anyways, on to where I get maced. I noticed a cute woman with a group of 3 other girls. I’m not the type to stare and ogle at if anything I take a quick glance at someone I find attractive but l addressed to my buddy that hey, she is pretty cute. So they help me muster up my courage to walk over and introduce myself. And it takes A LOT to put myself around new people.

My exact words were, “excuse me, but my nam..” and instantly got hit in the face with mace. Painful and absolutely embarrassing.

I don’t even know what I did. I never touched anyone, said anything or suggested anything vulgar, I honestly don’t know. Why did this happen? I don’t know what I did wrong.

(Edit) the person in question I was attempting to speak to was not the one who maced me, but rather one of their colleagues blind sided me.

Also, I’m unaware of what their group was dealing with this evening and maybe my approach was the final straw or something. But I approached her from an angle that didn’t come off like I was cornering her and could be seen, kept more than an arms length distance in a somewhat crowded place, I didn’t pester or badger her for attention, had she ignored my “excuse me” I would’ve just walked away and I certainly didn’t lay my hands on her or her colleagues at any point or linger around for more than a minute. I felt like what I did would be appropriate to approach someone.

*(UPDATE 8/24: I did not expect the post to get popular like it did and I appreciate the helpful info I was given. To answer some questions; yes the police were called right after the incident happened. Yes there were witnesses to what had happened. The bar was not packed but had a fair amount of people because it was a Tuesday night. 

I consulted a family member who’s a bar member and they’re going to find an attorney who would support my case. I was advised to visit a urgent care for a checkup and try to get prescribed eye drops and try to prevent any possible permanent damage to my eyes as well as find out if I was for sure sprayed with mace, pepper spray, or some other chemical. I was also told I can’t be promised anything serious would come out if it for a number of reasons including that most bars and clubs cameras don’t have the best if any audio and anything I said may or may not be audible because most bars are noisy environments and to expect them to fight back if they’re even caught. I can try to have the bar give me a copy of the footage and if they won’t give it to me I have to get a subpoena for it. I called the local police department that came out yesterday and I didn’t get much info but they will have someone contact me in the near future about the incident. At this point my main concern is if I get video with no audible audio, it’ll turn to a “he said and she said” situation. 

Lastly, this post was never meant to gain any sort of pity or legal advice. I was originally wondering if i did something wrong when I’m trying to get back into dating since I’m fully against dating apps. I honestly thought the incident would get brushed under the rug and would move on from it. This isn’t a post to label women bad either. Please don’t bring a misogynistic mentality into a conversation because you’re unhappy with your own experiences.",ww8f4e,2410,713,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ww8f4e/got_maced/

Online I don’t advertise my background, lifestyle, financial status. But when my matches ask what I’m looking for a do mention someone worldly, educated, well traveled. 

I say I’m looking for someone intellectual, educated worldly and suddenly it’s stop “chasing the top men”, “oh you only care about his income”, “wEll wHat dO yOu BrIng tO tHe tAble”. Which in my specific case is especially laughable as I have no need for his money.  

We are allowed to be attracted to whoever we are attracted to. I realize that means I’ll likely be single forever (per my last post) but it doesn’t make me a gold digger.

70,Please tell me I'm not the only woman who loses attraction to a guy who wants to have sex with other people while dating me.,"Maybe it's because I started dating late (in my 20s), but I only date men who make me happy and feel secure. And the only men who make me feel that way are guys who are totally, 100% into me (which I count as making me a dating and sexual priority i.e. monogamous sex). They're typically guys who make it clear they're not seeing anyone else very early on. I've had very healthy relationships with men as a result. No man I've dated has made me feel insecure or upset with him for his sexual habits.

The one guy who tried to get me to have non-monogamous sex with him (he was dating one other person and banging her), I was clear to him that I would NEVER have non-monogamous sex in my life and swiftly left on the spot when it was clear no compromise could be made. I believe I deserve monogamous sex. It's like a basic, basic requirement for me and for those women reading this who care about monogamy and are bothered by guys sleeping around, it should be a basic requirement for you too! I'm so much happier and relaxed while dating now.

Here are my thoughts: different people have different relationships with sex. I get that. Men tend to skew closer to polygamy than women, but on average I'd say most people (both genders) want monogamy eventually. If a guy doesn't want to try monogamy with me or if he tries to prolong the dating process unnecessarily long or is in anyway avoidant about commitment, I absolutely do not want anything to do with him.

If you are so upset about this that you are making a post on reddit or complaining to your friends, I have news for you: that man is not the one for you. I'm sorry, but if he's not making you super excited and happy and secure in yourself and your sexuality, YOU KICK HIM TO THE CURB.

Now, if you are a woman/man who genuinely enjoys sleeping around and exploring sexuality with multiple people, you do you! But also, you should date similar types of people and avoid getting involved with people who are clearly uncomfortable with you sleeping around",syy330,2286,485,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/syy330/please_tell_me_im_not_the_only_woman_who_loses/
71,Is it ok to become boyfriend and girlfriend after a week or two?,"I met a girl on tinder about two weeks ago. I asked her out as soon as I possibly could. We spent about 8 hours together on the first night. By the second date she had met one of my good friends. Third date I met her parents by happenstance and we opened up to each other about past relationships. Fourth date she met my parents and now she’s my date to my brother wedding on Sunday. 

At no point during this process did I ever feel forced to do something or even slightly uncomfortable. We have a ton in common. We started giving each other music recommendations as we both sing and play guitar but have super different tastes in music. 

Tonight I was dropping her off at her car and I just kinda felt like I wanted to call her my girlfriend and so I asked her and she said yes. 

It feels right to me. She hasn’t shown a single red flag. Her family is super nice. She gets along fantastically with my family. Talks about me all the time to her coworkers and family and I do the same. 

I’ve been in a relationship where I felt forced to progress quicker than I was comfortable with and this is not that. She gave me several outs as to moving too fast and I didn’t really feel the need to slow it down. Is it stupid to ask her so soon even though it has felt absolutely natural this entire time?",uyr0h1,2280,254,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/uyr0h1/is_it_ok_to_become_boyfriend_and_girlfriend_after/

73,The most WTF first date of my life,"So I downloaded Tinder and matched to this very attractive guy, we chat for a few days and he even called me a couple of times before we agreed to meet in person, he wanted to pick me up at my house but I preferred to see him at the place we would go. 
Everything was perfect, he was acting like a gentleman and the conversation was really good, I invited him to a party, introduced him to a couple of friends and after a while he kissed me, I responded the kiss, but then he started to get a little handsy and I had to keep moving his hands up, he asked me to go with him to a bar where “he used to work” I agreed only if we were back to the party later, so he took me to this bar and it turns out it was a male stripper bar, so he used to be a stripper, we left back to the party, but he said he wanted to pee and asked me to get close to him as if we were just talking and then he proceeded to take his D out and pee right on the street, next to a car 😳 then he tried to do the same again outside of the party but I stopped him and asked him please not to.
Finally, he takes me back to get my car but before that he goes into a motel without even asking me, I said hey what are you doing!? He said what? let’s go inside for just an hour, I insisted him to please get me back to where my car was, and he was pushing me to go to the motel only to “sleep” if I didn’t want to do anything else, I was mortified telling him several times that I didn’t want to, so he finally turned around and he was visibly annoyed and I was completely in shock, I told him he should’ve asked me first if I wanted to go there, I said I never sleep with anyone on a first date and he said that we were adults and there were no rules for that, I guess I just don’t understand how a person can be such a gentleman and then change so much afterwards and be so pushy, and the peeing thing next to me on the street... that’s just so weird, I’m so confused 🤯

EDIT I: For those who kind of excuse his behavior by saying “hey it’s Tinder, a hooking up app, what did you expect” he’s also in Bumble, so, the platform really doesn’t matter much, none of our previous chats and phone conversations had a single hint of something sexual, he didn’t even asked me for more pictures, he acted like he was genuinely interested in what I had to say and not on the looks, I understand now it was a facade but definitely not the fact that it was Tinder or I was only led to his looks only.",tj5mrr,2257,285,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tj5mrr/the_most_wtf_first_date_of_my_life/
74,Is it a red flag that a guy demanded I do my eyebrows before a date?,"I’ve been messaging with a guy and because I was busy the day he wanted to hang out this is what he said word to word:

“At least we’ll have time to make ourselves beautiful and we won’t embarrass ourselves. When I see a girl with a little moustache showing, untrimmed, eyebrows, nails and etc I go crazy. I cannot be doing more self care than her. Or with dirty shoes. Minimal hygiene is required”

Sorry if translation is bad. My question is because I feel like he shouldn’t be telling me to shave my eyebrows. I don’t shave my whole body except for my face so is what he said considered a red flag?


EDIT: Thank you everyone for commenting. I’m trying to read and reply to all of the comments. I messaged him saying how it’s inappropriate what he said. He started talking about how hair stops growing on the body but not on the head and how it’s aesthetically more pleasant to have less hair to which I replied that I find more hair more attractive. He said he expects women to have less hair on their arms than him to which I replied I don’t shave my arms/legs. 

Then he said he was joking yesterday, how everyone can do whatever they want, he’s just commenting and everyone has different opinions about the world and not to take his words too seriously, how he’s more blunt but always has good feelings and etc.

People ""notice"" you simply because you're alive. People can't necessarily notice you looking at someone in a ""lovely"" way. Even if, it's not specifically a boy's job to ask out a girl who is more into him.

77,Boyfriend exchanging NSFW messages with male best friend,"
I'm (F) dating this guy for 4 months now but he has been in my friend group for almost a year already.

He became close to my male best friend because they started taking extra classes at the same course. Everything was fine and we were all good friends, but one day the conversation about bdsm came up and we took the online test, it turned out me and this friend had the % for sub really high and my bf had the dom on the top. I think it went down hill from there.

After a couple weeks my best friend came to tell me that they were doing this type of ""friendship dynamic"" where my boyfriend orders my best friend around. At first i just found it funny and didn't care about it much. My friend said this included filling his waterbottle everytime he told him to, always bringing him coffee in the morning or carrying his stuff. I then asked if there were more things involved, like romantic feelings or sexual desire, my friend assured me it had nothing to do with that and it was just because he likes to be ordered around.
After that I talked to my boyfriend and he said the same thing and that besides all that he was sure about being straight and that he loved me. I trusted both of them and just forgot about the subject, my friend even hooked up with some guys in the mean time. 

HOWEVER, one day, when me and my boyfriend were getting ready to go out with said friend, he asked if i could text him trough his phone to confirm the time we would meet (because he was in the bathroom). I did, but then i felt the curiosity to roll up the conversation and saw it was way more than what they were telling me. My boyfriend made him do his homework, asked for pictures of him wearing women clothes and makeup, pictures kneeling down in said clothes and demanded he called him ""sir"". There were also messages like ""you've been dissobeying me lately"" or ""if you improve your behaviour you'll get a reward"" (never mentioning what type of reward it is) and he also called him names like ""little bitch"". There's probably more, i couldn't roll farther up (still looking for a opportunity to do so). When I think about it, i don't think something physical, like sex, actually happened between them, but now im in doubt if it would if they had the opportunity. My mind says it wouldn't.

I feel really betrayed by the two people i trusted the most and don't know what to do. If I tell my boyfriend he would know i went trough his messages. If I tell my friend the friendship would most likely be over. 

I don't think i should let this slide but i want to learn more before doing anything. I don't know what to feel or exactly what to do and would like some outside opinions.

We sat on the couch talking for hours while casually sipping red wine the whole time we were touching on eachother, she insisted I stay the night. We made our way to the bedroom and she excused herself to go get more wine. She came back to the room with the bottle wearing nothing but a thong. The sex was amazing and she really knew what she was doing with her mouth. We went for a couple of rounds and then chatted until we decided to sleep, during our conversation I complimented her head game and told her that usually I don't enjoy receiving oral (as I get off more from giving) and said that she was one of the few that got me really enjoying it. She asked if It'd be okay if she could taste me in the morning as a way to get me up. I woke up to morning head and then we messed around a few more times.

However my boyfriend has a bit of a temper especially when things don’t go his way and he wanted to take me to a park then and there and have sex. I kept opposing and got flustered that he’d bring it up so much. He proceeded to call me ‘lame’ and just get sassy and standoffish with me. We were headed home and my heart sank to my stomach when he took a wrong turn. We pulled over and immediately started telling him i didn’t want to have sex and he told me to ‘chill the fuck out’ and that we were just going for a walk. We ended up behind this building and he started touching me. I didn’t say no but i didn’t stop him. We did end up having sex and immediately after i felt so dirty and gross about myself. I just know that i didn’t want him mad at me because that verbally never goes well. Thinking about it now a few hours later it gives me a wave of anxiety and makes me want to close my eyes and shrink up. I don’t want to talk to him about this situation and how it made me feel because that will just result in an argument I won’t win. I don’t really know what i’m asking for here.

83,Women I just met being really forward. Her girlfriends told me to stay away from her. Not sure how to handle.,"
Hi, I(23M) went out with my good friend Daren(23M)last Friday. We met up at a bar and his two friends Jayden (23F) and Hayley(22F) were at the table. I never met them before. Before I get there I guess Daren told Jayden that I am “off limits”. I started talking to both Jayden and Hayley about random stuff. Jayden told me she goes to therapy twice a week. I told her I go once a week. I told her I enjoyed therapy and she tells me “wow green flag”. 10 minutes into talking with them I see jayden is noticeably very drunk. Jayden and I start talking about the gym because we both go a lot. We start talking about workouts. Jayden asks for my Instagram. She then asks if I am single which I tell her yes. She starts biting her lip when she looks at me, whispering to her friends, asking me very  forward sexual  questions. She asked Daren if she can switch spots in order for her to sit next to me. 

She later asks for my tik tok and she shows me videos of her making tik toks about other men she talks to etc. 
Later on that night she started making out with me. I am a very shy guy and I didn’t know how to handle this. She kept telling me I’m muscular, touching my pecs, arms, shoulders. I kind of ignored it. Both of her women friends told me to not go after her and Daren agreed. Is there a reason they are telling me this? I kinda think Jayden looks for a lot of male attention but maybe I’m reading this wrong. I hope I don’t sound misogynistic.

84,"Unless you are in an established relationship with someone, there needs to be a degree of emotional detachment regarding a potential future with them","
It’s natural to want a future with someone you find attractive, or think you have a connection with.

However, projecting romantic feelings onto someone you barely know—or a “friend” that you’ve never been romantic with—often leads to neediness and insecure attachment.

The fantasy perception of the person overtakes who they actually are. They are often placed on pedestal unnecessarily. In an attempt to keep this idealized person in your life, the interactions become less natural, more focused on pleasing them, rather than being yourself and allowing things to develop naturally.

When you meet someone you like, it’s fine to appreciate them, but be wary of forming an emotional attachment to them. There has to be a phase that is a trial period. Not only do they need to learn about you, but you also need to determine if they fit what YOU want.

Have fun, let things unfold naturally. A relationship will develop without planning or thought if you both have chemistry. Trying to force things to fit a romantic fantasy never works.",tyda33,2142,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tyda33/unless_you_are_in_an_established_relationship/
85,A guy got mad because I wouldn’t have sex with him without a condom,"I (19F) went home this guy (23M) I’ve been seeing for months. He told me he just wanted to see me as he was away for a few weeks. Before going home with him I told him that I don’t want to have sex with him. He agreed and even said he didn’t want to have sex either. He drove 30 mins to pick me up and go back to his home. We watched a movie while cuddling and he started to get very touchy. He put his hands inside my shirt and pants. From that point I knew that we were gonna end up having sex so I asked him if he had a condom and he said no. I closed my legs and then quickly pull up my pants but he kept opening them apart and taking off my pants. I said that I am not down to have sex if it’s without any protection. He asked me why and I answered that I am afraid to get pregnant as I’ve already had a pregnancy scare before and it was the worst feeling ever. I also said that there’s a chance of either of us catching an STD if we don’t use a condom, as we both have a history of having multiple sexual partners (getting an STD test in our country will cause deportation if resulted positive) He then insisted that he will not get me pregnant nor does he have an STD. At this point he’s starting to get mad and even said that he’s “not comfortable with using a condom”, to which I replied, “I am not comfortable without a condom.” The argument lasted for a few minutes and I was already starting to get uncomfortable and thinking about wanting to go home. 

In the end he told me that if I don’t want to have sex then I should just give him a head at least. I agreed but told him that I would like to go home immediately after. That kind of disappointed him and he walked out of the room. While he was out I was already starting to look for a ride home but before I found one he walked back in fully dressed and told me that he’s sending me back home. On the ride home neither of us said a single word and I really wanted to cry since this has never happened to me before. Once we reached my home I just said bye and he didn’t even look at me. I’ve been thinking of blocking him but I’m expecting some kind of apology and at the same time I kinda feel bad for him.

I haven’t been in a relationship for a couple of years now and have been trying to get back into the game via the online dating apps. I’ve had some success with matches and getting a conversation going, the only problem lies in when they ask me what I do for work. 

I work inventory for a hospital, it’s not exactly the most lucrative of jobs but it does pay enough for me to live alone with my dog fairly comfortably. I also deliver pizza as a second job for the extra income. As soon as I tell my matches this they ghost, or worse just unmatch me entirely. I think I’ve talked to 20 or so women and consistently had these results. 

It’s really destroying my confidence because I haven’t had the opportunity to go to college for numerous reasons (hence the second job!) but I also don’t want to be with someone who only sees me as a paycheck.

89,The woman I'm dating (25F) says she's going to platonically sleep over at her ex BF's place. How do I (25M) respond?,"UPDATE: THE NEXT DAY

The initial text is still unanswered, along with my phone call earlier today (Friday), which means Eve is likely going to sleep tonight having seen my text and phone call and ignored me. Tomorrow is the fated Saturday, and I expect to find out that she went through with her plans. I'll update sometime Sunday or Monday if anything important happens.

Yes, I'm defensive and in denial, I know her, and you don't, and I won't apologize for denying the majority position. Believe what you want, it doesn't matter to me, because the main problem is one of presumption; any position that presumes guilt before she's even done anything, while using one statement as absolute truth and proof, and another statement being thrown out as lies, makes no sense. Do with that what you will, I'm going to talk to her, and I'll know when I look her in the eyes and ask her directly if she telling me the truth.

END OF UPDATE, BELOW IS ORIGINAL POST

Honestly it's pretty simple. I'm seeing a woman (we'll call her Eve), we hit it off, and have had several dates, a bar, a cafe, and she's been over to my apartment twice, but we haven't gone to ""3rd base"" and she hasn't slept at my place.

I work odd hours, I was asleep late in the evening, and she calls me. I wake up, answer my phone when I see Eve's name. She's driving home, curios and chatty, and asks me a bunch of times to just talk about something, but I can't think of anything, I'm drowsy and still half awake with blackout curtains in the dark. I finally think about asking to do something together this weekend.

This is where my mind absolutely derails from happy and drowsy to confused and alert.

She says she already has plans on Saturday, she spending time with her ex-boyfriend (who we will call Bob), who is still a friend in some capacity, but I don't think I have the full explanation. I probe with a couple more questions, and discover she's planning to spend the night at his place, which means she's busy Sunday too. I'm now shocked into silence on the phone, and unable to continue a decent conversation, but I'm saved by a female friend calling Eve so she hangs up with me to take the other call.

I texted her about 12 hours later, the next morning, and that was 24 hours ago with no response. The text is basically ""Help me understand because I can't seem to make sense of [this] and it's bothering me.""

This is a deeply uncomfortable situation for me. I've come to care for her, we are starting to get to know each other, and her coworkers also liked me when I met them. 

I want to understand, but this also seems like a red flag. 

Is this visit to Bob's truly platonic? Why stay the night? This doesn't feel right, and I've always trusted my instincts, so it's truly bothering me.


EDIT:
I've seen several comments along the same lines, that I'm being used or tested in a twisted game. I'm going to disregard these and some other comments; I cannot understand the heartless among you who are so flippant in your advise. By both action and description she has repeatedly affirmed that to use/abuse or otherwise play games with me would be completely contrary to her character. Let me be clear, if she is using me or playing games, our next conversation will bring that to light and it will be the end of the relationship. However it is not clear to me that either her plans or current silence are certain enough indicators to be actionable to the extremes people have advised. I suppose I've gotten what I was looking for, I have checked my emotions and now see what most people think of the outward appearances of these circumstances, and this allows me to offer to anyone who will read this, my current decision for my course of action.

I will try to talk to her before Saturday, and should I be able to hold a reasonable conversation that clarifies mine and Eve's thoughts and actions, the two of us will decide how to proceed. 

If she refuses to have a conversation before going to her ex on Saturday and proceeds with her plans, I will not tolerate it. It is a strict boundary in my heart, if she goes, my doors close, both emotionally and physically. In truth, I can already feel my heart anticipating this outcome, and readying itself, because I do care about her and it would not be nothing to me to bar her from my life. 

Lastly, thank you.

90,"Maybe I’m the only one who feels like this needs to be said, but stop taking dating advice from people who dated in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.","I see men who take dating advice from their grandfather and they wonder why having a job and car doesn’t get them a girlfriend. All your grandfather needed was a job at a factory and a pickup truck to get laid because women were oppressed and couldn’t even open a bank account. He knows nothing about dating in todays time don’t listen to him.

I’ve met women who say their fathers tell them to “never ask a man out” or “don’t pay for anything until you’re married”. Those women cling to that and wonder why they might struggle dating. Also you know that your father is a misogynist right? And if he dated in modern times the same way he did when he was he’d probably get hemmed up on SA charges we’ve all heard stories.

This was probably more of a persona vent or rant and I had to get out, but pretty much don’t take dating advice from people who haven’t dated in the smartphone era.

93,Tinder date was a disaster,"So, after being single for almost two years after a very painful break up and doing a lot of work on myself, I (M41) decided to download Tinder and see how I get on with tentatively putting myself out there again. 

I met a really nice woman (F36). She was attractive, easy to talk to, interesting, funny. She was not long out of a messy break up herself so she said she was looking to take it slow with the right guy. Alright, so far so good. 

There was a festival in town at the weekend. Live bands, food trucks, that kinda thing, so we arranged to meet at 6pm on the Saturday and go check it out. 

Oh boy. She turned up very drunk. Like almost unable to stand drunk. Way more drunk than she wanted to admit to me, because she was insisting she was fine. I said we should get her some food and maybe a coffee to help her sober up and she said that’s a good idea, so we headed into the festival. We got some Mexican food, and as I was ordering, she also ordered two bottles of tequila beer and paid for them. So much for coffee. 

She proceeded to get even more drunk (or perhaps just maintain the level of drunk she was at) but insisted she was absolutely fine and can handle her drink. We sat and talked for a while, listened to some bands, drank, danced, it was nice, and after a bumpy start, I thought the date was actually going okay. 

Around 11pm, the festival was winding down for the night, so I said we should call it a night. She said she wanted to stay out “unless we’re leaving so we can go to your place to fuck”. 

Whoa! Okay. While I appreciated the offer, in good faith, I absolutely couldn’t have had sex with her being as drunk as she was. I’d had, like, three beers and wasn’t even buzzed and she was struggling to stand up. I said that I didn’t think that was a good idea this time, but maybe down the line, of course she can come back to mine. 

I think I said the wrong thing, because in the middle of the festival, well, she kinda lost it. She started yelling at me “what the fuck is wrong with you? Why don’t you want to fuck me?” I tried to calm her down but she continued “am I not pretty enough, or do you just have a tiny dick?” at this point, people are staring and coming over to ask if everything is okay etc. 

I said “okay then, let’s go” and we headed towards a taxi rank. When we got there, I opened the door for her, and she got in. I went round and got in the passenger side, and said to the driver “listen, here’s £20. Make sure she gets home”. My date wasn’t listening, she was singing away in the back seat. I got out of the taxi, and stood and watched bewildered as it drove away. Ten minutes later, I got a text saying “I’m home! Goodnight”. 

The next day, she texted to say she had a great time, but is so embarrassed that she doesn’t feel like she can see me again. She then blocked my number and I’ve not heard from her since. 

Sex on the first date hadn’t crossed my mind, but either way, I’d feel so uncomfortable sleeping with someone as drunk as she was. It wouldn’t have been right. 

Did I do the right thing or was I a bit of an arsehole to her? Is this what dating is like now? 

I feel like I wanna keep trying to meet someone but dunno if it’s worth the hassle now",wksq6b,2033,514,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wksq6b/tinder_date_was_a_disaster/

95,Follow up on my Best Friends Wife's Tinder profile... Not the outcome i had in mind but definitely a positive one!,"Here's the original post... [https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/v1y8i0/i\_35m\_just\_found\_out\_on\_tinder\_that\_the\_wife\_34/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/v1y8i0/i_35m_just_found_out_on_tinder_that_the_wife_34/)

After many days of thinking about how to tell my friend about seeing his Wife's photos on Tinder, i decided to just straight out tell him everything. I figured its the best way!

I gave him a video call on Viber on Wednesday afternoon when i knew his Wife was still at work, as he finishes work earlier than her and i knew i had around 1-2 hours to talk.

I asked him how everything was he said everything is fine. I asked how his business is going he said great. I asked him how everything is with ""X"" his wife he said amazing! I was starting to feel bad so i didnt want to just sugarcoat questions and stress him out and just got to the point!

I told him i had seen a profile on Tinder with photos of his Wife, with a different name age and location and some photos which i hadnt sen on any of her other social media, but i wasnt sure if it was a fake account or her. He didnt look angry... I even asked him if they were in an open marriage, which is totally cool so many people do that and so many people are happy with that arrangement and this is where he got angry and his answer was ""Are you kidding dude? F\*ck NO! Why the f\*ck would i want that?!

I was expecting him to be really shocked about telling him what i saw, but for some reason he wasnt, it's like he had a suspision about it before... I hadnt heard from him since Wednesday and i gave him a call yesterday, he didnt answer (he always does his phone is on him 24/7 due to his work) So i waited for about 2 hours and texted him asking ""You ok dude?"" And he gave me a call back on friday afternoon while he was driving...

He told me on Friday he checked his wifes phone when she was doing the laundry, and went through it to find any apps, nothing. He then opened all apps that he was sure of and he found an app called FLO and it was pink and had a feather... He thought it was weird because she was on the pill a few months after their second Child was born that was 4 years old now...

He opened it, and what do you know... He found her Tinder profile... He saw she had a different name, location, age, and general bio... He saw about 200 matches and about 20-30 scroll downs filled with probably more than 100 messages from dozens of guys dating back to 2 years ago...

He opened a lot of the chats, they were extreme... Most of them flirting and sexting, and a lot of them saying things like ""I cant wait to meet up again, i still think about all those things you did to me and im just getting wet thinking about them..."" (i cant put the details here its a lot) A lot of those messages even had hook up times, almost all of them where from the times of 6-9pm.

He felt sick to his stomach, feeling the ground underneath his collapsing and just felt sick! He took photos with his own phone on a lot of messages and her profile....  
Well so apparently the loving Wife & Mother he has turned out to be a sex addict, and now everytime she was late at work he is thinking how many of those were true.

Now he was thinking how many guys she slept with which was more than 40 based on the messages confirming how much she liked what they did to her... He put her phone back in her bag, went to the downstairs bathroom, and felt so nauseated and puked and started to cry for a few minutes and then decided to go to his office to cool down and telling his Wife he had to go fix some client portfolios and be back in a few hours even though he knew she would probably be using Tinder the moment he left...

When he told me all this, i felt so bad because i was really hoping it was a fake profile... I told him i was so sorry and i was sorry for telling him all this and he said ""No man youre like a brother even it it was a fake profile i wouldnt get mad at you... Im just lost right now and have a lot to think about... I had some thoughts that she was being weird somertimes but my mind would never even go there..."" I told him again im really sorry and that if he needs anything to just call me!

He called me today told me he spoke to his Cousin, who is a divorce lawyer and also a district Attorney, and his cousin advised him to get as many facts and evidence as he can... Not only through her phone, but her icloud and emails etc...He felt even more sick but is going to work out how to do that as well...

His Cousin told him, with enough evidence and a witness or two from hotel clerks who are willing to testify seeing her at times she was ""working late"" with someone else even though she never paid for anything with a back trail or the guys paying, but through finding dates and times of messages confirming the hookup and by showing her photos to the clerks to find the video feed of the hotels security cameras if they had some too...

He is going to spend the next few weeks gathering all the information he can, and he is going to proceed filing a divorce once he has everything he needs...

He even asked if i was willing to testify, and i said ""WITHOUT A DOUBT!"" And then i told him lets call all the old gang from 20 years ago and hang out next Saturday ordering pizzas and beer or even going out all together! He said he was in and he's gonna call up everyone to arrange it...

So im looking forward to that and thats something nice to get his mind off things!

TL;DR This was a long and scattered post but people had asked me to follow up on what happened... I feel bad for him, but you know what? F\*CK HER! She didnt respect him or her family! I feel ZERO remorse for whats going to happen to her and she shouldnt have cheated! People like this deserve to get screwed over! When the person youre with has supported you more than anyone you've ever met, paying off your loans and being there when your Dad was sick and dying, hiring doctors and paying for everything, and this is your thank you? Yeah... She can GFH!

P.S To all those people who kept saying ""Mind your own business!"" you can also GFY for since so many of you are cheaters and you hate if someone ruined your precious affair!",v5k78z,2004,382,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v5k78z/follow_up_on_my_best_friends_wifes_tinder_profile/
96,"I broke up with someone who loves me, and it's harder than I thought","I (25F) have been seeing an incredibly sweet guy (28M) for 4 months, he is amazing on paper. But throughout the whole relationship, I was overwhelmed with anxiety feeling that it was not right. Like, I was not letting myself fall for him, and kept pushing it away. I felt like he was in a honeymoon phase without me. He treated me like noone else, 

I finally got up the courage to break it off - and I feel terrible. We had an incredibly long heart-to-heart break-up. I thought it would lift a weight off my chest, but I feel like crap. Maybe because I really care about him, maybe because I know that I shattered his heart. He told me he was in love with me, and I think I am the first person he has been in love with. I am now so confused with emotions, did I have he same feelings for him without realizing? Or are breakups just hard on everyone involved? I can't stop crying and feeling like I messed up and might never find someone like him again.",sh4v58,2001,271,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sh4v58/i_broke_up_with_someone_who_loves_me_and_its/

98,Date got pissed because I snuck snacks into movie theater lol....,"On a third date with this girl I matched with originally on fb dating, we decided to do a movie date and go to the theaters. I was the one that originally bought the tickets ahead of time. As tradition whenever I'm dating other partners, we always end up sneaking snacks or food into the theater cause we're not going to overpay for that ridiculous priced food or candy LOL. In a joking manner leading up to the date, I gave my new date a heads up thru text that she better bring the biggest purse she has so we could sneak snacks in. Thru text she basically laughed at the comment and we went back and forth thru friendly banter. But she basically said she won't be my accomplice. So yesterday was the date, before going to the theater, I stopped by Walgreens (like I always do for snacks for the movies) and got candy/drinks for both of us. I had an idea of what she liked candy wise and drink wise so I got her a coke and snickers lol. When I arrive to the movies, she's waiting outside the theater and she was shocked seeing me carry a bag with snacks in it LOL. She seemed immediately turned off by the idea of it. Idk if she thought I was joking the whole time. Basically she had a small purse and she was like I'm not helping you sneak that stuff in. She ended up putting one of my candy boxes in her purse while I put both our drink cans in my pockets and other candy in my back pocket LMAO. But I could tell my her body language she was pissed alittle. Anyway she didn't think I'd be able to pull it off and get caught, but guess what, I was able to get my muscle milk and runts into the theater along with her coke and snickers 🤣🤣🤣🤣 just a funny story I wanted to share.

*Update* I texted my date from yesterday asking her if I made her feel uncomfortable because of putting her on the spot with the snack situation. Do note it seemed like we still had a good time at the movies yesterday and she did text me when we both got home she had a good time. She actually reached out first today asking me how my Sunday was. Here's her response about the snack situation:

99,Guy told me I “should” check my cholesterol after I sent him a picture of my steak dinner. Red flag?,"So we had our first date yesterday. He sent me a picture of the cheese and sausages he was preparing today. So I sent him a picture of the steak dinner I cooked for myself. There’s one small steak and a single egg with tomatoes. He replied “No blue cheese. Also you should consider a cholesterol test if you are eating that much steak and eggs.” Was he being negative? Somehow I feel this is some kind of PUA trick to make me feel bad about myself. Is it a red flag or am I overthinking this?

Edit: I replied “It’s not much! It’s only one egg.” He replied “Everyday though. Adds up.” I then asked “Do you always offer health/diet advice” and he replied “just for a diet like that.” I then asked “what’s your cholesterol ratio” and he answered “Idk just know it’s good.” Sooo I ditched him.",sf768x,1999,580,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sf768x/guy_told_me_i_should_check_my_cholesterol_after_i/
